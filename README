doc/
    Various already-formatted documents --
    a mixture of troff, MS Word, PDF, and LaTeX.

images/
    Various images used on the website (e.g., logo, backgrounds,
    favicon).

md/
    Markdown sources for all the top-level pages on the site.

md/issues/
    Markdown sources for the issue pages.

static/
    Other static files (e.g., CSS, Javascript).

templates/
    HTML templates for building the website.

tools/
    Tools for building the website.

To build the website, run make in the top-level directory.
It will build the site under the htdocs/ directory (this can
be overridden with "make BUILD_DIR=some-other-directory").
Using make will update the build directory based on what files
have changed.

You can also use tools/build.sh to build the website. This
script will build everything, and will hard-link the static
files into the build directory, rather than copy them.

The .gitignore file is set to ignore everything under htdocs/.
