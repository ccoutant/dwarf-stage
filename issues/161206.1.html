Section 2.6.1.2, pg 42
The current definition of the placement of a DW_OP_bit_piece within a
register reads:

      If the location is a register, the offset is from the
      least significant bit end of the register.

This is ambiguous and may not be appropriate in some cases:

1. The term &quot;least significant bit end&quot; is not defined, and there are
   cases where its definition is not obvious, particularly on
   big-endian platforms.  For instance, consider vector- or
   floating-point registers.  (An attempt for defining a register's
   least significant bit might look like this: &quot;The least significant
   bit of the first/last byte in the register's natural memory
   representation, on little-/big-endian platforms, respectively.&quot;)
2. The definition does not allow for widening a register set beyond
   each of its registers' &quot;least significant bit&quot;, such as it occurred
   with z/Architecture when the FP registers were expanded to vector
   registers.
3. Assuming that DW_OP_piece is just an abbreviation for a
   DW_OP_bit_piece operation with offset zero, this would preclude the
   use of DW_OP_piece for cases like single-precision FP values in a
   double-precision FP register on big-endian platforms.

One way of clearing this up would be to leave the placement to the
ABI.  This would also reduce the need for a more formal definition of
the terms &quot;register&quot;, &quot;natural memory representation&quot;, &quot;least
significant bit end&quot;, etc.

E.g., change the definition to the following:

      If the location is a register, the placement of the piece
      within that register for the given size and offset is
      defined by the ABI.

1.  Least significant bit is well defined for registers and values,
and is not dependent on the endianity of the memory representation
for these values.  Some architectures allow a value to be stored
in either big- or little-endian format; this does not alter the
representation in the registers.

2.  &quot;Widening a register&quot; is a concept out of the scope of the
DWARF Specification.  This appears to be a Quality of Implementation
issue.

3.  How a value is loaded into the register (perhaps by loading a
single-precision FP value into a double-precision FP register as
mentioned) does not change the register format, nor does it change
the interpretation of DW_OP_piece or DW_OP_bit_piece.  How a
producer generates a DWARF expression is a Quality of Implementation
issue.
