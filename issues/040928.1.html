Background 

If one was to encounter a DW_OP_addr in the middle of a
DW_CFA_expression, how is one supposed to determine the size of a target
address, so they know how many bytes to read?  You could find the
debug_info compile unit that references the same code as the FDE, but
there are a lot of hoops to jump through to do this.  Also, some
compiler vendors always generate .debug_frame sections, even if no other
debugging information is generated.  Thus, they cannot rely on there
being a .debug_info compile unit header to find the address size.

The same is true for DW_CFA_set_loc.

We have always encoded all target addresses as 4-byte values for all
ISAs to avoid these issues, even if they are actually smaller.  I'm just
curious about how a completely generic DWARF reader might handle this,
without any knowledge of the target architecture.

|&gt; &gt;initial_location in the FDE, and the DW_CFA_set_loc operand.  One is
|&gt; &gt;tempted to suggest using some compilation unit's address size, but
|&gt; &gt;.debug_frame is supposed to be self-contained.

|&gt; &gt;It seems to me this is worth bumping the version number to fix.

Ron (Brender?) writes (attribution not really clear):
|&gt; But does one good fix deserve another -- or three?
|&gt;
|&gt; The .debug_line section has the same problem. Shall we bump its
|&gt; version number (actually we already did) and add an address_size
|&gt; byte there too?
|&gt;
|&gt; Worse yet are the .debug_loc and .debug_ranges sections -- these
|&gt; have no header at all, hence no version number to bump, hence no
|&gt; possibility to upwardly add an address_size header field at all!
|&gt;
|&gt; Sigh...

PROPOSAL (revised 4/2/2007):

This change requires changing the version number of .debug_frame.

In the .debug_frame section, add address size and segment size fields
to CIEs.  Specifically, in section 6.4.1, add, between 'augmentation'
and 'code_alignment_factor' in the CIE text:

    5.  address_size (ubyte)

    The size of a target address in this CIE and any FDEs that use it, in
    bytes.  If a Compilation Unit exists for this frame that Compilation
    Unit address size must match the address size here.

    6.  segment_size (ubyte)

    The size of a segment selector in this CIE and any FDEs that use it,
    in bytes.

In the FDE description, add the following to the end of the
description of 'initial location':

    If the 'segment_size' field of this FDE's CIE is non-zero, the
    initial location is preceded by a segment selector of the given
    length.

In section 6.4.2.1, &quot;Row Creation instructions&quot;, change the word
'address' in the first sentence to 'target address', to make it
clearer that the size of the field is controlled by the CIE's
address_size field.  To the end of the paragraph, add the sentence:

    If the 'segment_size' field of this FDE's CIE is non-zero, the
    address operand is preceded by a segment selector of the given
    length.

Proposal accepted 6/5/2007.
