Section: 2.16.3, 4.1
Page: 59

This is a follow-up to issue 030626.1; Chris Quenelle [Chris.Quenelle@Sun.COM]
was too busy to do a write-up, so I volunteered.  If I've understood things
correctly, the initial issue was left unresolved and a subsidiary issue was 
resolved.  Chris was going to design a system which tied the discontiguous
scopes to source locations rather than to machine instructions, but he now
believes that's too open a topic to bring up for V3.  I'm not addressing that
issue, but am adressing the initial issue from the 030626.1.

The issue is this: given a variable which has a &quot;live&quot; scope in a source block
that has been itself chopped into a set of discontiguous (and possibly re-ordered
set of instruction blocks), how do we represent the sub-blocks in which the variable
is live, and where does that &quot;liveness&quot; start?  I'll note in passing that it might
make semantic sense for the liveness to start and stop more than once, given the
re-ordering.

The current state is this text in 4.1, bullet 11:

   If the containing scope is non-contiguous
   (see Section 2.16.3), the value of this attribute is
   the offset in bytes of the beginning of the scope
   for the object from the beginning of the first range
   list entry (that is not a base selection entry or an
   end of list entry).

   [editing note: I'd remove the parentheses around  &quot;(that...entry)&quot;;
    I think they're unneeded.]

This describes an object scope which begins somewhere after the
start of the source code scope's ranges, but which is &quot;live&quot; from that 
point to (implicitly) the end of the source code's ranges.  This means
it is live even during intervening ranges from other bits of source,
so it's not completely accurate.

However, I believe that text will do for V3, so 030626.1 can stay resolved!

Here is the proposal for V3+, based on the suggestions (e.g. from Jim 
Blandy and David Anderson) in topic 030626.1:

Add after the above quote (4.1, bullet 11)

[added text]
    If the scope of the object itself is discontiguous, the scope has
    more than one start location, or DW_AT_start_scope for some reason
    will not correctly represent the scope of the object, the object
    entry may instead have a DW_AT_scope_ranges attribute.  The value of this
    attribute is a rangelist of the ranges in which the object is in scope.
[end added text]

Given that this is a rangelist, we don't need to add text explaining
what the offsets are from: that's already defined.

Given that the object ranges are discontiguous, there's no need to
call out any one of the &quot;starts&quot; as _the_ start, so the two attributes
aren't going to co-occur and we can then make them alternates.

Note that the use of DW_AT_scope_ranges is not restricted to the case
that the enclosing code scope is discontiguous.

Proposal (Ron Brender, 7/8/2007):

1) In Section 2.17, page 32, insert the following just before the
beginning of Section 2.17.1:

     &quot;In addition, a non-contiguous range of addresses may also be
     specified for the DW_AT_start_scope attribute as described in
     Section 2.17.3.&quot;


2) In Section 2.17.3, append to the first paragraph:

     &quot;Similarly for a DW_AT_start_scope attribute.&quot;


3) In Section 4.1, p61, replace the first paragraph of bullet 11, namely

     &quot;11. If the scope of an object begins sometime after the low pc   	
     value for the scope most closely enclosing the object, the
     object entry may have a DW_AT_start_scope attribute. If the
     containing scope is contiguous, the value of this attribute is
     the offset in bytes of the beginning of the scope for the
     object from the low pc value of the debugging information entry
     that defines its scope. If the containing scope is
     non-contiguous (see Section 2.17.3), the value of this
     attribute is the offset in bytes of the beginning of the scope
     for the object from the beginning of the first range list entry
     that is not a base selection entry or an end of list entry.&quot;

with the following:

     &quot;11. If the scope of an object is smaller than (that is, a subset
     of the addresses) for the scope most closely enclosing the object,
     the object entry may have a DW_AT_start_scope attribute. There are
     two cases:

      1) If the scope of the object entry includes all of the containing
         scope except for a contiguous sequence of bytes at the beginning
         of that containing scope, then the scope of the object is
         specified using a value of class constant. If the containing
         scope is contiguous, the value of this attribute is the offset
         in bytes of the beginning of the scope for the object from the
         low pc value of the debugging information entry that defines
         its scope. If the containing scope is non-contiguous (see
         Section 2.17.3), the value of this attribute is the offset in
         bytes of the beginning of the scope for the object from the
         beginning of the first range list entry that is not a base
         selection entry or an end of list entry.

      2) Otherwise, the scope of the object is specified using a value
         of class rangelistptr. This value indicates the beginning of
         a range list (see Section 2.17.3).

     <i>Due to optimization, the scope of an object may be non-
     contiguous and require use of a range list even when the containing
     scope is contiguous. Conversely, the scope of an object may not
     require its own range list even when the containing scope is non-
     contiguous.</i>&quot;
