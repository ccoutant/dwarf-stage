Title: DWARF Debugging Information Format

# Welcome to the DWARF Debugging Standard Website

DWARF is a debugging information file format used by many compilers and
debuggers to support source level debugging. It addresses the
requirements of a number of procedural languages, such as C, C++, and
Fortran, and is designed to be extensible to other languages. DWARF is
architecture independent and applicable to any processor or operating
system. It is widely used on Unix, Linux and other operating systems, as
well as in stand-alone environments.

## DWARF Version 5

Version 5 of the [DWARF Debugging Information Format Standard](dwarf5std.html)
is now available.

While each revision of the standard documents the DWARF language codes
that had been assigned as of the publication date, support for new
languages may be added between revisions.

[View the list of language codes](languages.html).
