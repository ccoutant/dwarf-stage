Title: Sample Proposal Template

# Sample Proposal

Over the years we’ve found the following rough outline to be helpful.
Depending on the proposal, not all of these sections are necessary.

The title of the proposal should be specific and descriptive.
Please avoid vague titles such as “Extensions,” “Improvements,”
or “Clarifications.”

We use the [markdown][md] language (basic syntax with table extensions)
to render issues on the website. You can use the following template
as a starting point:

    # Title

    ## Background

    Describe why the current DWARF Standard cannot do what you need to do,
    or why it is inadequate. Provide any background information about the
    problem you’re trying to address with this proposal. Please try to be as
    concise as possible.

    ## Overview

    Provide a brief overview of the changes you’re proposing. Describe how
    the proposed changes will improve the standard.

    ## Proposed Changes

    We advise citing specific document page and line numbers, with quotes of
    small parts of the existing text where necessary, followed by the
    suggested revisions.

    ## Dependencies

    Usually there should not be dependencies on other issues. If there are,
    please list them here.

    ## References

    References to additional relevant documents. These should not be
    required reading, however; the background and overview should provide
    enough information that the proposal can stand on its own.
