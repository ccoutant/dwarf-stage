Title: DWARF Public Comments

# Public Comments

The DWARF Committee invites comments from the public about the
**DWARF Version 5 Standard**. Comments may range from grammatical or
editorial notes, to requests for clarification, to suggestions for
modifications to the standard.

Please send comments to the
[dwarf-discuss](mailto:dwarf-discuss@lists.dwarfstd.org) mailing list.
Please provide the section number, page number, and type of comment in
your email.

The type of comment can be:

* _Editorial_ — comments about typos, grammar, wording, etc.
* _Error_ — comments about anything which appears to be incorrect.
* _Ambiguity_ — parts of the standard which appear inconsisent.
* _Improvement_ — suggestions for better ways to describe DWARF.
* _Clarification_ — requests or proposals for clarification about the standard.
* _Enhancement_ — suggestions or proposals for future support in DWARF.
* _Other_ — anything else.

## Guidelines for Writing Proposals

Please keep in mind the following guidelines when submitting proposals:

* Each proposal should be about a single topic. Please do not combine
  unrelated changes in a single proposal. (Changes are unrelated if they
  have no interactions or dependencies.)

* The title of the proposal should be specific and descriptive. Avoid
  vague language such as “Extensions,” “Improvements,” or “Clarifications.”

* Keep proposals as short as possible. (Of the current proposals, only two
  are over two hundred lines and the overwhelming majority are under one
  hundred lines.)

Please see the [sample template](sample-proposal.html) for proposals
that reflects some of the best practices we have observed.
Following this template will help the committee understand your proposal.

Proposals for a change to the DWARF Standard will be assigned an issue number,
and will be reviewed by the committee. The proposal may be assigned
a champion on the committee who may contact the original author for
additional information or background. When the committee has decided
to accept or reject the proposal, we will report the decision to the
original author, and it will be listed on the [Current Issues](issues.html) page.
For more information about the life of a proposal, see the
[Procedures](procedures.html) page.
