Title: DWARF Public Comments

# Public Comments

The DWARF Standard Committee invites comments from the public about the
**DWARF Version 5 Standard**. Comments may range from grammatical or
editorial notes, to requests for clarification, to suggestions for
modifications to the standard. Currently, comments can be sent to the
[dwarf-discuss](mailto:dwarf-discuss@lists.dwarfstd.org) mailing list.
Please provide the section number, page number, and type of comment in
your email.

The type of comment can be:

* _Editorial_ — comments about typos, grammar, wording, etc.
* _Error_ — comment about anything which appears to be incorrect.
* _Ambiguity_ — parts of the standard which appear inconsisent.
* _Improvement_ — comments about better ways to describe DWARF.
* _Clarification_ — request for clarification about the standard.
* _Enhancement_ — suggestions for future support in DWARF.
* _Other_ — anything else.

Please review the [submission guidelines](submissions.html)
and keep in mind the following guidelines:

* Each proposal should be about a single issue. Please do not combine
  unrelated changes in a single proposal. (Changes are unrelated if they
  have no interactions or dependencies.)

* The subject of the proposal should be specific and descriptive. Avoid
  vague subjects such as “Extensions,” “Improvements,” or “Clarifications.”

* Keep proposals as short as possible. (Of the current proposals, only two
  are over two hundred lines and the overwhelming majority are under one
  hundred lines.)

Proposals which do not meet these criteria will be returned to the
submitter for revision.

Proposals for a change to the Standard will be assigned an issue number,
and will be reviewed by the DWARF Committee. The proposal may be assigned
a champion on the committee who may contact the original author for
additional information or background. When the committee has decided
to accept or reject the proposal, we will report the decision to the
original author, and it will be listed on the [Current Issues](issues.html) page.
For more information about the life of a proposal, see the
[Procedures](procedures.html) page.
