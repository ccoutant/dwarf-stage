# DWARF 3.0 Standard

The DWARF 3.0 Debugging Format Standard is based on the DWARF 2.0 Standard.

to the previous standard.

The major enhancements in DWARF 3.0 are:

* Support debugging data files larger than 4 GBytes

* Allow references to debugging information entries in other shared libraries

* Support Fortran 90 modules as well as allocatable array and pointer types

* Support C (as revised for 1999)

* Support Java

* Namespace support for C++

* Add optional section for global type names

* Use UTF-8 for name strings

* Improved support for optimized code

* Improve the ability to eliminate duplicate debug info

The DWARF Version 3.0 Standard has been superceded
by [DWARF Version 4](dwarf4std.html).
