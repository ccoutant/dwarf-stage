Title: DWARF Committee Member Participation Agreement

# DWARF Debugging Information Format Committee Member Participation Agreement

*(Draft) April 16, 2021*

The DWARF Committee [bylaws](bylaws.html) article 2 item 3 states:
“Members shall be active participants in the development and extension
of the DWARF Debugging Format.” Members specifically agree to do the
following things.

1.  Abide by the bylaws and any other policies and practices adopted
    by the Committee, including the Code of Conduct.
   
    _The bylaws, policies, and practices (including this Agreement) are
    available to the public on the [website](index.html). Enforcement of
    all of these is at the discretion of the Executive Committee.
    [Bylaws](bylaws.html) article 8 item 1 requires that (a) members
    affirm they have authority to act on behalf of an employer they
    represent, (b) all submissions or contributions are without license
    or other encumbrance._

2.  Attend the majority of Committee meetings.

    _These are typically held “remotely” via telephone or video conference
    call; this is our primary forum for discussions and decisions about
    DWARF issues. Meetings may also have other kinds of business. Inform
    the Chair of any planned absences or technical difficulties._

3.  Actively participate in committee discussions (no “wallflowers”).

    _We produce the best results when we have to understand and address
    various perspectives and viewpoints. It is especially valuable to ask
    questions or speak up about topics that you did not initiate. That
    said, we try to keep discussions focused on the topic at hand._

4.  Be willing to champion issues.

    _[Issues](issues.html) may be filed by anyone; each issue has a
    designated (preferably volunteer) champion on the Committee, who will
    present it to us for discussion. That might include re-drafting the
    issue to conform to current Committee practices. The final form of
    any changes to the DWARF specification remains the responsibility of
    the Editor._

5.  Participate on the dwarf-workgroup mailing list.

    _This members-only list is where we discuss topics outside of business
    meetings. Topics might include issues before the Committee; ideas
    that might result in new issues being filed; and any other relevant
    topics. People often post revisions to their issues on the mailing
    list, which helps everyone stay current; of course the
    [website](index.html) has the definitive content for each issue.
    Committee meeting announcements, agendas, and minutes are also posted
    to the mailing list._

Note: Attendance is recorded in the minutes, and champions are listed on
the website. There is no formal tracking for anything else.
