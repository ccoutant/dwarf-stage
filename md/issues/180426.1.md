Section 6.2.4.2, pg 159

Add DW_FORM_strp_sup to the list of allowed form in section 6.2.4.2 on page 159.

Section 6.2.4.1 allows DW_LNCT_path to be paired with DW_FORM_strp_sup, but 
DW_FORM_strp_sup is not in the list of allowed forms for vendor defined line 
descriptions in 6.2.4.2. This seems inconsistent. It is also inconsistent with 
the forms allowed to be used for vendor defined macro descriptions (the list of 
forms is identical, except for DW_FORM_strp_sup).
