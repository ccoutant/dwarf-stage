Section 6.2.4.2, pg 159

Add `DW_FORM_strp_sup` to the list of allowed form in section 6.2.4.2 on page 159.

Section 6.2.4.1 allows `DW_LNCT_path` to be paired with `DW_FORM_strp_sup`, but 
`DW_FORM_strp_sup` is not in the list of allowed forms for vendor defined line 
descriptions in 6.2.4.2. This seems inconsistent. It is also inconsistent with 
the forms allowed to be used for vendor defined macro descriptions (the list of 
forms is identical, except for `DW_FORM_strp_sup`).
