Section 3.1.1, pg 62
There are occasional requests to assign a new `DW_LANG` code.  Rather than have
these assignments wait in limbo until the next version of the DWARF Standard, 
it would be better to assign them on the fly, as needed.  This would avoid 
confusion, different languages using the same code, or the long-term use of
values in the user-assigned range.

Proposal:
Committee chair can assign `DW_LANG` codes as needed.  List of codes will 
be displayed on DWARF website.

A registration page for languge codes and array lower bounds will be created.
Proposed language code assignments will be copied to DWARF mailing list for comment.
