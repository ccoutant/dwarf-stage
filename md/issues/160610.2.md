Section 7.5.4, pg 161

In the table of attribute form encodings table (Figure 21 page 161) in the 
specification for DWARF4 there is a gap. The entries go

Form name            Value   Class
`DW_FORM_ref_udata`    0x15    reference
`DW_FORM_indirect`     0x16    (see Section 7.5.3)
`DW_FORM_sec_offset`   0x17    lineptr, loclistptr, macptr, rangelistptr
`DW_FORM_exprloc`      0x18    exprloc
`DW_FORM_flag_present` 0x19    flag
DW_FORM_ref_sig8     0x20    reference 

Note the value counts from 0x19 to 0x20, not 0x1a as might be expected. I 
wondered if this the gap was left intentionally (perhaps to allow for future 
expansion) or by mistake but I can't find an answer one way or the other?

   No gap exists in DWARF Version 5.
