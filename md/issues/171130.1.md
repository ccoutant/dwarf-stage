Section E.3.2, pg 388

dwarf 5 text reads:

References to other `.debug_infosections` follow the approach suggested above, but the naming 
rule is slightly different in that the <file-designator>should be interpreted as a <file-designator>.

It should read the same as in the dwarf4 and dwarf3 spec:

References to other `.debug_info` sections follow the approach suggested above, but the naming 
rule might be slightly different in that the <file-designator> should be interpreted as a 
<function-designator>.

Probably just a simple copy and paste error led to <file-designator> being repeated twice.


RESOLUTION

This is a typo as surmised in the Issue report.

In line 24, replace "<file-designator>" with "<function-designator>".
