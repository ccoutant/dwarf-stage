Section B.2, pg 281

The notes for links in figure B.2 "Split DWARF Section Relationships" after
(k) are missing, in particular:
* (lo): from ".debug_str_offsets.dwo" to ".debug_str.dwo"
* (lmo): from ".debug_line.dwo" to ".debug_str_offsets.dwo"
* (mo): from ".debug_macro.dwo" to ".debug_str_offsets.dwo"
* (po): from ".debug_macro.dwo" to ".debug_str.dwo"

There is a note for a link (fo) which is missing in the figure.

RESOLUTION

Add the following text at the end of Section B.2:

(lo)      .debug_str_offsets to .debug_str.dwo
Entries in the string offsets table are offsets to the corresponding string text
in the .debug_str.dwo section.

(lmo)   .debug_line.dwo to .debug_str_offsets.dwo
The value of a DW_FORM_line_strp form refers to a string section specific
to the line number table. This form can be used in a .debug_line.dwo section
(as well as in a .debug_info.dwo section).

(mo)    .debug_macro.dwo to .debug_str_offsets.dwo
Within the .debug_macro.dwo sections, the second operand of DW_MACRO_define_strx
and DW_MACRO_undef_strx operations is an unsigned LEB128 value interpreted as an
index into the .debug_str_offsets.dwo section.

(po)     .debug_macro.dwo to .debug_str.dwo
Within the .debug_macro.dwo sections, the second operand of DW_MACRO_define_strp
and DW_MACRO_undef_strp operations is an unsigned LEB128 value interpreted as an
index into the .debug_str.dwo section.

For the missing arrow that goes with (fo), add an arrow directed 210 degrees (SSW)
from .debug_info.dwo to a small circle containing an asterask (implicitly 
something external).

There is also a missing arrow from .debug_macro.dwo back to inself, for DW_MACRO_import...
