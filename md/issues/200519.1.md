Section B.2, pg 281

The notes for links in figure B.2 "Split DWARF Section Relationships" after
(k) are missing, in particular:
* (lo): from "`.debug_str_offsets`.dwo" to "`.debug_str`.dwo"
* (lmo): from "`.debug_line`.dwo" to "`.debug_str_offsets`.dwo"
* (mo): from "`.debug_macro`.dwo" to "`.debug_str_offsets`.dwo"
* (po): from "`.debug_macro`.dwo" to "`.debug_str`.dwo"

There is a note for a link (fo) which is missing in the figure.

RESOLUTION

Add the following text at the end of Section B.2:

(lo)      `.debug_str_offsets` to `.debug_str`.dwo
Entries in the string offsets table are offsets to the corresponding string text
in the `.debug_str`.dwo section.

(lmo)   `.debug_line`.dwo to `.debug_str_offsets`.dwo
The value of a `DW_FORM_line_strp` form refers to a string section specific
to the line number table. This form can be used in a `.debug_line`.dwo section
(as well as in a `.debug_info`.dwo section).

(mo)    `.debug_macro`.dwo to `.debug_str_offsets`.dwo
Within the `.debug_macro`.dwo sections, the second operand of `DW_MACRO_define_strx`
and `DW_MACRO_undef_strx` operations is an unsigned LEB128 value interpreted as an
index into the `.debug_str_offsets`.dwo section.

(po)     `.debug_macro`.dwo to `.debug_str`.dwo
Within the `.debug_macro`.dwo sections, the second operand of `DW_MACRO_define_strp`
and `DW_MACRO_undef_strp` operations is an unsigned LEB128 value interpreted as an
index into the `.debug_str`.dwo section.

For the missing arrow that goes with (fo), add an arrow directed 210 degrees (SSW)
from `.debug_info`.dwo to a small circle containing an asterask (implicitly 
something external).

There is also a missing arrow from `.debug_macro`.dwo back to inself, for `DW_MACRO_import`...
