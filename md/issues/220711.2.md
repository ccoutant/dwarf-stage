Section 6.1.1, pg 139
The overview layout on page 139, Figure 6.1,
has grey links to each block of data in the table.

Except for Abbrev Table!

The String Offsets, Entry Offsets, and Index Entries
blocks  could be shrunk a bit to allow room for
an Abbrev Table block just above the Index Entries
block.  

Thus reinforcing and clarifying the intent of the
wording describing the name table header record. 
6.1.1.4.1 page 143.
