Section 5.7.7, pg 110

Compare these two ways of declaring a destructor:

struct S {
   ~S() {}
};

struct T {
   ~T() = default;
};

DWARF currently provides no way to distinguish these, but in the
Itanium C++ ABI, there is a difference, and the debugger needs to
know. In the first case, with a user-defined destructor, S is not
a trivial class, and the calling convention for a function that
returns S requires the caller to pass the address of a buffer for
the return value as an implicit first parameter. In the second
case, with a default destructor, T is trivial, and the calling
convention allows it to return the value on the stack.

Similarly, it may be necessary for a consumer to know if a
special member function has been explicitly deleted.

In order to represent deleted and default special member
functions, we should add a `DW_AT_provided` attribute with the
following values:

    `DW_PROV_declared`
    `DW_PROV_implicit_default`
    `DW_PROV_explicit_default`
    `DW_PROV_explicit_delete`

The rules in the C++ standard for determining whether a class is
trivial can depend on more details of the class than a consumer
can gather from the DWARF information, and may vary from one
version of the standard to the next. In order to give the
consumer an explicit indication of whether a class is trivial, we
should add a `DW_AT_layout` attribute with one of the following
values:

    `DW_LAYOUT_unspecified`
    `DW_LAYOUT_non_trivial`
    `DW_LAYOUT_trivial`
    `DW_LAYOUT_pod`

If the layout is unspecified, the consumer may attempt to
deduce it based on the knowledge it has of the class structure
and of the target ABI.

To allow the producer to represent these attributes with as
little additional space as possible, we should also add a new
FORM code, `DW_FORM_const_present`, that encodes a constant
value directly in the abbreviation declaration.


Changes to the spec:

Add the following rows to Table 2.2 ("Attribute names"):

    Attribute        Identifies or Specifies
    ---------        -----------------------
    `DW_AT_layout`     Class layout

    `DW_AT_provided`   How a special member function is
                     provided in the source code

Add the following non-normative paragraph to Section 5.7
("Structure, Union, Class and Interface Type Entries"):

    C++ has the notion of a "trivial" class, whose objects can be
    bitwise copied, and a "POD" ("Plain Old Data") struct or
    class, representing a structure that can be shared with code
    written in other languages. Trivial or POD classes may have
    different rules for passing objects of that type as
    parameters or return values.

Add the following paragraph to Section 5.7.1 ("Structure, Union
and Class Type Entries"):

    A structure type, union type or class type entry may have a
    `DW_AT_layout` attribute, whose value indicates whether it is a
    non-trivial, trivial, or POD type. If not present, the layout
    is assumed to be unspecified. <non-normative>If unspecified,
    a consumer may be able to deduce the layout based on its
    knowledge of the type and the ABI.</non-normative>

Add the following paragraph to Section 5.7.7 ("Member Function
Entries"):

    If the member function entry describes a special member
    function then that entry may have a `DW_AT_provided` attribute
    whose value is one of the following:

    * `DW_PROV_declared` (assumed if no `DW_AT_provided` attribute is
    present) identifies a special member function that is
    declared normally in the source code, whether or not there is
    an explicit definition.

    * `DW_PROV_implicit_default` identifies a special member
    function that is not declared in the class, but was provided
    as a default implementation by the compiler.

    * `DW_PROV_explicit_default` identifies a special member
    function that is declared in the class with "= default".

    * `DW_PROV_explicit_delete` identifies a special member
    function that is declared in the class with "= delete".

In Section 7.5.3 ("Abbreviations Tables"), add the following
paragraph immediately following the paragraph beginning "Finally,
the child encoding is followed by a series of attribute
specifications":

    The attribute form `DW_FORM_const_present` is a special case.
    For attributes with this form, the attribute specification
    contains a third part, which is a signed LEB128 number. The
    value of this number is used as the value of the attribute,
    and no value is stored in the `.debug_info` section.

In Section 7.5.4 ("Attribute Encodings"), for class "constant",
change "seven forms" to "eight forms", and add to the end of the
paragraph:

    There is also a implicit constant (`DW_FORM_const_present`),
    whose value is provided as part of the abbreviation
    declaration.

Add the following rows to Table 7.5 ("Attribute encodings"):

    Attribute name          Value   Classes
    --------------          -----   -------
    `DW_AT_layout`            xxx     constant
    `DW_AT_provided`          xxx     constant

Add the following row to Table 7.6 ("Attribute form encodings"):

    Form name               Value   Classes
    ---------               -----   -------
    `DW_FORM_const_present`   xxx     constant

Add the following sections to Chapter 7 ("Data Representation"):

    7.X Class Layout Codes
    
    The encodings of the constants used in the `DW_AT_layout`
    attribute are given in Table 7.XX.

        Table 7.XX Class layout encodings

        Layout code name         Value
        ----------------         -----
        `DW_LAYOUT_unspecified`     0x00
        `DW_LAYOUT_non_trivial`     0x01
        `DW_LAYOUT_trivial`         0x02
        `DW_LAYOUT_pod`             0x03

    7.Y Special Member Function Codes

    The encodings of the constants used in the `DW_AT_provided`
    attribute are given in Table 7.YY.

        Table 7.XX Special member function encodings

        Special member function code name    Value
        ---------------------------------    -----
        `DW_PROV_declared`                      0x00
        `DW_PROV_implicit_default`              0x01
        `DW_PROV_explicit_default`              0x02
        `DW_PROV_explicit_delete`               0x03

In Appendix A, Table A.1 ("Attributes by tag value"), add
`DW_AT_layout` to `DW_TAG_class_type`, `DW_TAG_struct_type`, and
`DW_TAG_union_type`. Add `DW_AT_provided` to `DW_TAG_subprogram`.
