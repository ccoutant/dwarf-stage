Section 6.2, pg 128
This proposal introduces a new two-level line number table to
DWARF, splitting the current line number table into two parts: a
"logicals" table, and an "actuals" table. The actuals table would
be optional, and when omitted, the logicals table would
correspond to the DWARF v4 line number table.

In a two-level line number table, the logicals table would
provide a mapping from each logical statement in a program to a
recommended breakpoint location, and the actuals table would
provide a mapping from PC location to a logical statement
represented in the logicals table. The separation allows the line
number table to represent directly the nesting of inline
functions so that consumers would not need to parse the DIE tree
in order to show inlined calls.

For further background information and possible future
extensions, see the DWARF Wiki page:

   <http://wiki.dwarfstd.org/index.php?title=TwoLevelLineTables>

In Section 6.2 ("Line Number Information"), add the following
non-normative text at the end of the section:

>     For optimized code, where instruction scheduling may reorder
>     instructions across statement boundaries, where loop
>     optimizations may clone code and move instructions across
>     loop iterations, and where inlining may introduce
>     instructions from an inlined call into the instruction
>     stream, an alternate representation with two matrices may be
>     used. One matrix (the "logical line table") would have a row
>     for each "logical" source statement. If the emitted object
>     code for a source statement has been cloned into two
>     different locations, there would be a separate row for each.
>     The code for a source statement in an inlined function would
>     have a separate row for each instance, and would refer to its
>     calling context -- i.e., the logical source statement within
>     which it was called. The matrix would have columns for:
> 
>     * the source file name
>     * the source line number
>     * the source column number
>     * the function name
>     * recommended breakpoint location for this statement
>     * the calling context (a reference to another row)
>     * and so on
> 
>     A second matrix (the "actual line table") would have a row
>     for each instruction in the emitted object code, and would
>     have columns for:
> 
>     * the logical statement (a reference to a row in the first
>     matrix)
>     * whether this instruction is the beginning of a basic
>     block
>     * and so on
> 
>     Both of these matrices can be stored using the same byte-code
>     language mentioned above.

In Section 6.2.2 ("State Machine Registers"), add the following
rows to Table 6.2:

>     Register name    Meaning
>     ------------------------------------------------------------
>     context          An unsigned integer indicating a row number
>                      in the logical line table that represents
>                      the calling context for the current
>                      logical statement. Rows are numbered
>                      beginning at 1. The value 0 indicates that
>                      the current logical statement is not part
>                      of an inlined call.
> 
>     function_name    An unsigned integer representing the name
>                      of the function containing the current
>                      logical statement. This value is either a
>                      string offset relative to the start of the
>                      .debug_str section, or the index of an
>                      entry in the .debug_str_offsets section,
>                      depending on a flag in the line number
>                      program header (see Section 6.2.4).
>     ------------------------------------------------------------

Following Table 6.2, add the following notes:

>     When only a single line number table is used, the context
>     register is not used.
> 
>     When both a logical line table and an actual line table are
>     used, the basic_block and isa registers are not used in the
>     logical line table. The file, column, is_stmt, prologue_end,
>     epilogue_begin, discriminator, context, and function_name
>     registers are not used in the actual line table. In the
>     actual line table, the line register represents a row in the
>     logicals table rather than an actual line number. Rows in the
>     logical line table are numbered starting at 1.

Following Table 6.2, add the following rows to the (unnumbered)
table showing the state of the registers at the beginning of each
sequence:

>     context          0
>     function_name    0

In Section 6.2.4 ("The Line Number Program Header"), modify
item 3, insert items 4 and 5, and renumber all subsequent items:

>     3.  header_length
>         The number of bytes following the header_length field to
>         the first byte of the line number program for the logical
>         line table (or for the line number table is there is no
>         actuals table). In the 32-bit DWARF format, this field is
>         a 4-byte unsigned length; in the 64-bit DWARF format,
>         this field is an 8-byte unsigned length (see Section 7.4).
> 
>     4.  actuals_table_offset
>         The offset in bytes from the end of the header to the
>         first byte of the line number program for the actual line
>         table. If there is only one line number table, this field
>         is 0. In the 32-bit DWARF format, this field is a 4-byte
>         unsigned length; in the 64-bit DWARF format, this field
>         is an 8-byte unsigned length (see Section 7.4).
> 
>     5.  function_name_form (ubyte)
>         The format of the function_name register. If this value
>         is DW_FORM_strp, the function_name register contains an
>         offset relative to the start of the .debug_str section.
>         If this value  is DW_FORM_strx, the function_name
>         register contains an index of an entry in the
>         .debug_str_offsets table.

(In Section 6.2.5.1, "Special Opcodes", no change is necessary,
unless we want to explicitly point out that the new context and
function_name registers are left unchanged by the special
opcodes.)

In Section 6.2.5.2 ("Standard Opcodes"), add the following new
opcode:

>      13. DW_LNS_inlined_call
>          The DW_LNS_inlined_call opcode takes two unsigned LEB128
>          operands. It sets the context register to the value of
>          the first operand, and the function_name register to the
>          value of the second operand.
> 
>          *This opcode may also be used to set the context register
>          to zero, to indicate that a logical statement is not part
>          of an inlined call.*

In Section 6.2.5.3 ("Extended Opcodes"), add the following new
opcode:

>     6.  DW_LNE_set_function_name
>         The DW_LNE_set_function_name opcode takes a single
>         unsigned LEB128 operand. It sets the function_name
>         register to the new value.
