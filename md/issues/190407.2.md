Section 5.7, pg 113

In some large code bases I work on (such as Zig's stage1 compiler), there is 
a structure with a large union, of which only one is valid at a certain time, 
and clarified based on an ID attribute. It would be nice if the DWARF standard 
could clarify a way that the program could provide a clarifying function that 
would say which option of the union is valid at any certain time.

While this function that gets called would be hard to write in C or C++ (and 
the compiler doesn't have enough information to figure this out), as there is 
not much introspection abilities, in Zig it would be easy, and it would improve 
the utility of the debugger.
