Section D.4, pg 235

The D.4 Member Function Example flags member functions that don't return a value
with a DW_AT_type pointing to a DW_TAG_unspecified_type with name "void". This is
wrong because the functions don't actually return a "void", the don't return a
value at all and so according to section 3.3.2 they should not have a DW_AT_type at all.

Suggested change:

In Figure 59. Member function example: DWARF description remove the DW_AT_type
(reference to 1$) from the 7$, 10$ and 12$ DW_TAG_subprograms for func1, func2 and func3.
