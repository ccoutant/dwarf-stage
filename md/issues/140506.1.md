Section D.4, pg 235

The D.4 Member Function Example flags member functions that don't return a value
with a `DW_AT_type` pointing to a `DW_TAG_unspecified_type` with name "void". This is
wrong because the functions don't actually return a "void", the don't return a
value at all and so according to section 3.3.2 they should not have a `DW_AT_type` at all.

Suggested change:

In Figure 59. Member function example: DWARF description remove the `DW_AT_type`
(reference to 1$) from the 7$, 10$ and 12$ `DW_TAG_subprograms` for func1, func2 and func3.
