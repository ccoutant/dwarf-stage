Section , pg 
The OCaml language is described at: http://ocaml.org/

There is an experimental branch to generate DWARF output:
https://github.com/mshinwell/ocaml/tree/4.01-perf-annotate
which Mark Shinwell (the author of that branch) is hoping to
go upstream.  At that point, the OCaml compiler will produce
native code with DWARF annotations.

Therefore I would like to request that DWARF supports
OCaml as a language:

In section 3.1.1, Figure 8. Language Names, add
   `DW_LANG_OCaml`, OCaml
to the list of supported languages.

In section 7.12, Figure 33. Language Encodings, add
   `DW_LANG_OCaml`, 0x0017, default lower bound = 0

Accepted 10/23/2013.  Assigned 0x1B to `DW_LANG_OCaml`.
