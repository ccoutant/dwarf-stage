Section 2.6.1.2, pg 29

The `DW_OP_bit_piece` description talks about the meaning of offset for empty 
location descriptions, register location descriptions and memory addresses, but don't 
talk about its meaning for implicit location descriptions (`DW_OP_stack_value` and 
`DW_OP_bit_piece`).  

I'd say they should be handled like register location descriptions, i.e. offset 
should be from the least significant bit of the value on the top of the stack.
