Section 6.1.2, pg 148

The .debug_aranges section provides information about the address ranges
associated with a particular compilation unit. It explicitly states that the
ranges must be non-zero length.  Discussion around using zero length ranges
to represent a removed range, revealed that some compilers can create valid
entities, such as functions, which are zero length. I therefore propose
removing the non-zero requirement.

No further requirement, or recommendation, on how a consumer should
interpret such a range is required. It can, for example, choose to ignore it.

Textual changes:
