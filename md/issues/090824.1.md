Background
----------
In Fortran, an array has a number of "dimensions", one per index. 
"INTEGER X(10)" declares a ten-element integer array; the elements 
of X are laid out sequentially in memory.

As of the 2008 standard, Fortran also defines "coarrays".  A coarray 
is an array or scalar which has at least one "codimension".  
Codimensions are indexed with square brackets rather than parentheses.  
A "*" must be used as the size of the last codimension and means "up to
a limit based on the number of processes".  The implication of a
codimension is that as the index values of the codimensions vary, 
the array elements are striped across multiple processes.  Note that
processes may be on different processors.  

For example, the coarray "INTEGER X(10)[*]" is a coarray of an array
of integers.  It has a dimension of 10 and a codimension of "*" (the 
current number of processes).  In each process there are ten elements 
laid out sequentially in memory.  In process 1 there are the ten 
elements "X(1)[1]" to "X(10)[1]"; in process 2 there are the ten 
elements "X(1)[2]" to "X(10)[2]" and so on through all the processes.  
Any process can refer to the elements in other processes using the 
square bracket notation.  References without square brackets (e.g. 
"X(3)") are references to the local coarray -- the one which would be 
coindexed with the current process' process number.  There is a 
semantic difference the 'bare' reference and one using the current 
process number but that doesn't matter for DWARF.

A scalar coarray is one where there is only a codimension.  Thus 
"INTEGER Y[*]" is a scalar in each process but the scalars in other 
process can be referred to with the square bracket notation.


Examples 
--------

---[ Scalar that is a coarray ]---

Source:

      INTEGER X[*]

Debug data:

<1><100> `DW_TAG_coarray_type`
         `DW_AT_type` <90>                 <-- points to "integer" base type

<2><110> `DW_TAG_subrange_type`
         `DW_AT_lower_bound` 1

<1><120> `DW_TAG_variable`
         `DW_AT_name` "X"
         `DW_AT_type` <100>                 <-- points to `DW_TAG_coarray_type`

The type of the variable "X" is not just the base type of integer, but a 
type which is a coarray of the base integer types.  That type has a child 
entry which is the codimension.

         `DW_AT_type` <300>                 <-- points to `DW_TAG_array_type`        

<2><350> `DW_TAG_subrange_type`

Proposal:

Section 2.2, page 8:  
Figure 1, Tag names: Add `DW_TAG_coarray_type` after `DW_TAG_base_type`.

After section 5.4, page 84, add new section Section 5.5 (and renumber remaining sections):

In Fortran, a "coarray" is an array whose elements are located in different
processes rather than in the memory of one process. The individual elements
of a coarray can be scalars or arrays.

Coarrays are indexed by "codimensions" using a "coindex" or "coindices".

*How coarray elements are located and how coindices are converted to
process specifications is processor-dependent.*

A coarray is described by a debugging information entry with the tag 
`DW_TAG_coarray_type`.   Like `DW_TAG_array_type`, these entries have 
`DW_TAG_subrange_type` child entries which describe the codimensions and
`DW_AT_type` attributes pointing to the element type.

*In a coarray application, the run-time number of processes in the application
is part of the coindex calculation.  It is represented in the Fortran source by
a coindex which is declared with a "*" as the upper bound.  To express this
concept in DWARF, the `DW_TAG_subrange_type` child entry for that index would have
only a lower bound and no upper bound.*
