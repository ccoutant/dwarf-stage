Section .debug_rnglists, pg 242

The description of the .debug_rnglists section and the .debug_loclists section
looks different from other sections' descriptions.

For example, these sections' descriptions all start with "Each set of entries ...".

7.21 Address Range Table (Page 235)

* Each set of entries * in the table of address ranges contained in the 
.debug_aranges section begins with a header containing: ...

7.26 String Offsets Table (Page 240)

* Each set of entries * in the string offsets table contained in the 
.debug_str_offsets or .debug_str_offsets.dwo section begins with a header 
containing: ...

7.27 Address Table (Page 241)

* Each set of entries * in the address table contained in the .debug_addr 
section begins with a header containing: ...

However, the description of the .debug_rnglists and .debug_rnglists sections 
start with "Each section begins with ...".

7.28 Range List Table (Page 242)

* Each .debug_rnglists and .debug_rnglists.dwo section * begins with a header 
containing: ...

7.29 Location List Table (Page 243)

* Each .debug_loclists or .debug_loclists.dwo section * begins with a header 
containing: ...

Actually, the .debug_rnglists and .debug_loclists section can have multiple 
tables like other DWARF sections.

Discussion
=========
Agreed that the terminology in 7.28 and 7.29 is worth improving.
However the 3 examples (.debug_aranges, .debug_str_offsets, and
.debug_addr) are relatively simple lists, so the term "each set of
entries" is fairly clear. I'm not sure it's as applicable to
.debug_rnglists and .debug_loclists.

In Split DWARF and elsewhere the term "contributions" is used to
describe the chuck of a section that's referenced from another section
or is otherwise standalone from other chunks. Perhaps we should use
that here?

We could generalize that to the other cited sections too -
consistently using the "contribution" wording in all of these
sections.

Proposal
=======
Change the wording at the start of the following sections to the following

7.21 (Page 235) .debug_aranges
"Each .debug_aranges section contribution begins with a header containing: ..."

7.26 (Page 240) .debug_str_offsets
"Each .debug_str_offsets or .debug_str_offsets.dwo section
contribution begins with a header containing: ..."

7.27 (Page 241) .debug_addr
"Each .debug_addr section contribution begins with a header containing: ..."

7.28 (Page 242) .debug_rnglists
"Each .debug_rnglists or .debug_rnglists.dwo section contribution
begins with a header containing: ..."

7.29 (Page 243) .debug_loclists
"Each .debug_loclists or .debug_loclists.dwo section contribution
begins with a header containing: ..."
