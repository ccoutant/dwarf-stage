Section 3.1.1, pg 
DWARF defines DW_LANG_C and DW_LANG_C89, but only one language
constant for C++.  There is no way for a consumer to know which
version of the language was used to compile a given CU.
This matters for expression parsing in gdb; different versions of
C++ have different features.

Need to distinguish C++98, C++03, and C++11 versions of the C++ standard.

Proposal:

Page 44, Section 3.1 add:
  DW_LANG_C_plus_plus_03  ISO C++:2003
  DW_LANG_C_plus_plus_11  ISO C++:2011

Page 173, Section 7.12, add:
  DW_LANG_C_plus_plus_03  0x0017  0
  DW_LANG_C_plus_plus_11  0x0018  0
