Section 7.12, pg 230

I would like to request the assignment of a `DW_LANG_` constant for the 
Netwide Assembler (NASM). Currently we are using 0x8001, `DW_LANG_lo_user+1`,
which is documented in most tools as `DW_LANG_Mips_Assember`. This is clearly
bogus, and fails to distinguish NASM from other kinds of assemblers.

Rather than "squatting" on a user code, having one officially assigned is 
always preferable.

The Netwide Assembler can be found at <https://www.nasm.us/>, and is widely used.

Many thanks.
