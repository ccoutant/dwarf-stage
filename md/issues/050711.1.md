[This follows on from a discussion earlier this year on the dwarf-discuss 
mailing list entitled: Referring to the stdin 'file' in `.debug_macinfo` 
sections.  The first email in the discussion was sent by me on Thu, 21 Apr 
2005.]

Section 6.3.2 of Draft 9 of the DWARF Standard says:

..If the base source file for a compilation is submitted to the compiler via 
some means other than via a named disk file (e.g. via the standard input 
stream on a UNIX system) then the compiler should still produce ... the file 
name indicated (indirectly) by the `DW_MACINFO_start_file` entry of the pair 
should designate a line number information file name entry consisting of a 
null string.

Unfortuantely a null string is also taken to terminate the list of files in 
a `.debug_line` section (see 6.2.4 item 11).  And so implementations that follow
the above can cause incorrect `.debug_line` sections to be produced.

PROPOSAL (as suggested by Michael Eager)

change the end of the first paragraph of Section 6.3.2 to read:

..entry of the pair should designate a line number information file name 
entry consisting of a filename '-'.
