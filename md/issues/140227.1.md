Add the marked text below to Section 2.13.2:

2.13.2 Declarations Completing Non-Defining Declarations

A debugging information entry that represents a declaration that
completes another (earlier) non-defining declaration may have a
`DW_AT_specification` attribute whose value is a reference to the
debugging information entry representing the non-defining declaration.
A debugging information entry with a `DW_AT_specification` attribute
does not need to duplicate information provided by the debugging
information entry referenced by that specification attribute.

When the non-defining declaration is contained within a type that has
been placed in a separate type unit (see Section 3.1.4), the
`DW_AT_specification` attribute cannot refer directly to the entry in
the type unit. Instead, the current compile unit may contain a
"skeleton" declaration of the type, which contains only the relevant
declaration and its ancestors as necessary to provide the context
(including containing types and namespaces). The `DW_AT_specification`
attribute would then be a reference to the declaration entry within
the skeleton declaration tree. The debugging information entry for the
top-level type in the skeleton tree may contain a `DW_AT_signature`
attribute whose value is the type signature (see Section 5.7.1).

It is not the case that all attributes of the debugging information
entry referenced by a `DW_AT_specification` attribute apply to the
referring debugging information entry.

For example, `DW_AT_sibling` and `DW_AT_declaration` clearly cannot apply
to a referring entry.

Add this additional section to Appendix E, either before or after
E.2.2, "Type Signature Computation Grammar":

E.2.x Declarations Completing Non-Defining Declarations

Consider a compilation unit that contains a definition of the member
function N::A::v() from Figure E.9. A possible representation of the
debug information for this function in the compilation unit is shown
in Figure E.xx.
