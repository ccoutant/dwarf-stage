Section Appendix A, pg 

The attribute `DW_AT_entry_pc` is described in section 2.18 "Entry Address".   

In this section it states:

"Any debugging information entry describing an entity that has a range of code 
addresses, which includes compilation units, module initialization, subroutines, 
ordinary blocks, try/catch blocks, and the like, may have a `DW_AT_entry_pc` attribute
to indicate the first executable instruction within that range of addresses."

However the following tags in the table in Appendix A appear to be missing this attribute:
`DW_TAG_catch_block`
`DW_TAG_compile_unit`
`DW_TAG_lexical_block`
`DW_TAG_partial_unit`
`DW_TAG_try_block`
`DW_TAG_with_stmt`
