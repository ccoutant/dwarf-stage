Section 5.14, pg 102
Overview:
Adding `DW_TAG_descriptor_type` to describe descriptors-specific attributes.

Background:
Some languages, such as Fortran, provide types whose values may be dynamically 
allocated or associated with a variable under explicit program control. Currently, 
these attributes, such as `DW_AT_allocated` and `DW_AT_associated` are placed on the 
corresponding type DIE.  This approach forces creation of duplicate types for a
single Fortran type.

Consider this Fortran example:
type :: dt (l)
  integer, len :: l
  integer :: arr(l)
end type

integer :: n = 4
contains

subroutine s()
type (dt(n))               :: t1
type (dt(n)), pointer      :: t2
type (dt(n)), allocatable  :: t3
end subroutine

end

t1, t2 and t3 all share the same type 'dt'.  The current DWARF spec 
places all descriptor related attributes (`DW_AT_data_location`, `DW_AT_associated`
and `DW_AT_allocated`) on the `DW_TAG_structure_type` DIE for 'dt'.  However, we 
can't put all the descriptor specific attributes on the same `DW_TAG_structure_type`
DIE because there is a need to differentiate between t1, t2 and t3.  This forces 3
different 'dt' `DW_TAG_structure_type` to be created to describe this program.

Proposal:
This would modify the wording to 5.14 "Dynamic Type Properties".

A base or user-defined type may be accessed through a descriptor.  A descriptor 
is represented in DWARF by the debug information entry with the tag 
`DW_TAG_descriptor_type`. It has a `DW_AT_type` attribute, whose value is a reference 
to a debugging information entry describing a base type, a user-defined type or a 
type modifier.

5.14.1 Data Location
The `DW_AT_data_location` attribute may be used with `DW_TAG_descriptor_type` that 
provides one or more levels of hidden indirection and/or run-time parameters in its 
representation.  (Rest of text same as current text...)

5.14.2 Allocation and Association Status
The `DW_AT_allocated` attribute may optionally be used with `DW_TAG_descriptor_type` 
for which objects of the associated type can be explicitly allocated and deallocated.  
(Rest of text same as current text...)

The `DW_AT_associated` attribute may optionally be used with `DW_TAG_descriptor_type` 
for which objects of the associated type can be dynamically associated with other 
objects.  (Rest of text same as current text...)

The new DWARF for the example program would look like:

$11: `DW_TAG_structure_type`
      `DW_AT_name` (dt)
$12:  `DW_TAG_member` ...

$13: `DW_TAG_descriptor_type`        ! plain version
      `DW_AT_data_location` (...)
      `DW_AT_type` ($11)

$14: `DW_TAG_descriptor_type`
      `DW_AT_data_location` (...)
      `DW_AT_associated` (...)       ! 'pointer'
      `DW_AT_type` ($11)

$15: `DW_TAG_descriptor_type`
      `DW_AT_data_location` (...)
      `DW_AT_allocated` (...)        ! 'allocatable'
      `DW_AT_type` ($11)

$16: `DW_TAG_variable`
      `DW_AT_name` (t1)
      `DW_AT_type` ($13)
      `DW_AT_location` (...)
$17: `DW_TAG_variable`
      `DW_AT_name` (t2)
      `DW_AT_type` ($14)
      `DW_AT_location` (...)
$18: `DW_TAG_variable`
      `DW_AT_name` (t3)
      `DW_AT_type` ($15)
      `DW_AT_location` (...)
