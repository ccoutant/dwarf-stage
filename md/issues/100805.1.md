Section 2.19, pg 40
This was raised on dwarf-discuss by Mathieu Lacage
<mathieu.lacage@gmail.com> 2 Aug 2010 in the thread "decoding of form
entries".

If one of the "applicable attributes" listed in 2.19 has a reference
form, how do we obtain the value of the attribute?

Two interpretations were suggested on the thread.

Michael Eager wrote:

  generally you would search the referenced DIE to find the same
  attribute.  In some cases, like `DW_AT_specification`, there are
  multiple attributes in the referenced DIE.

David Gross wrote:

  I see a different pattern in D.2.2 (Ada Example): 13$ contains a
  `DW_AT_upper_bound` whose value is a reference to a variable.  The
  variable does not contain a `DW_AT_upper_bound`; the value of the
  variable itself is the value of the `DW_AT_upper_bound`.  That's the
  pattern that I expected to see; I wasn't aware that the standard
  intends to support the delegation pattern you describe above.

The standard should be explicit about the intended interpretation(s).

The second bullet in Section 2.19, pg. 40, reads as follows:

  - For a reference, the value is a reference to another
    entity which specifies the value of the attribute.

Revised text:

  - For a reference, the value is a reference to another DIE.  This DIE may
     -- describe a variable which contains the attribute value
     -- describes a constant which is the attribute value
     -- contain a DWARF expression which computes the attribute value
        or is a dwarf procedure which computes the attribute value
