Section 6.1.1.4.5, pg 145
In the DWARF 5 PDF, I see this text:

Version 9.0.0. The original symbol name, as it appears in the source code, should
be stored in the name table.name index!case folding

I think that "name index!case folding" text is probably intended to link to the index.
In dwarf5/latexdoc/otherdebugginginformation.tex I see:

name, as it appears in the source code, should be stored in the name 
table.\addtoindex{name index!case folding}

Somehow, though, this leaked through.

RESOLUTION
----------

The LaTeX source for the DWARF specification has multiple "high level" commands for indexing,
all of which include the LaTeX \index command. Of interest here are

\newcommand{\addtoindex}[1]{#1\index{#1}}
\newcommand{\addtoindexx}[1]{\index{#1}}

The \addtoindex{parm} command expands to keep parm in the running text and make
parm into an index entry. The \addtoindexx{parm} command expands to nothing in
the running text but does make parm into an index entry (sugar for \index if you will).

In the problem case cited above \addtoindex should be \addtoindexx.
