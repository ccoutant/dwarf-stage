UPC is a new language based on C.

(Documentation then the UPC Quick reference card may be a good place
to start, or maybe "Getting started with UPC". I wouldn't start with
the formal spec !)

Not really.

Although the initial description for users can be condensed into a
small space the full specification remains quite large, and the
implementation is non-trivial (talk to Larry Meadows if you want some
in Sun experience).

The current UPC standard is extensions ISO-C. I cannot imagine anyone
now starting a UPC implementation which was UPC extensions to an older
C dialect.

But surely you know this from the fact that the language is DW_LANG_Upc.

I don't believe so. IMO UPC is best treated as a different language
from C. And, in any case DWARF has already taken the view that the
different dialects of C you cited (which are _more_ similar than C and
UPC) are best treated as different languages, so there seems little
reason to change that model on account of UPC.


PROPOSAL:

add the new language code
   DW_LANG_Upc   0x12 or whatever is the next value in the table (sec 7.12).
