The D programming language (http://dlang.org) defines three type
qualifiers: const, immutable, and shared. They are similar in
effect on types to the qualifiers in other languages (such as
const in C++). Adding attributes for these type qualifiers to
DWARF would improve inspection and debugging of D programs.

Proposal
--------

DW_TAG_const_type and DW_TAG_shared_type currently exist and can be 
used with the D language.


In Table 5.3 (pg 105),
change 
  DW_TAG_shared_type        UPC shared qualified type
to 
  DW_TAG_shared_type        Shared qualified type

change
  DW_TAG_const_type     C of C++ const qualified type
to
  DW_TAG_const_type     Const qualified type

add 
  DW_TAG_immutable_type     D Immutable type

In Table 7.3 (pg 199), add
  DW_TAG_immutable_type     0x4b

In Appendix A (pg 251), add 
  DW_TAG_immutable_type     DECL
                            DW_AT_name
                            DW_AT_type
