The D programming language (http://dlang.org) defines three type
qualifiers: const, immutable, and shared. They are similar in
effect on types to the qualifiers in other languages (such as
const in C++). Adding attributes for these type qualifiers to
DWARF would improve inspection and debugging of D programs.

Proposal
--------

`DW_TAG_const_type` and `DW_TAG_shared_type` currently exist and can be 
used with the D language.


In Table 5.3 (pg 105),
change 
  `DW_TAG_shared_type`        UPC shared qualified type
to 
  `DW_TAG_shared_type`        Shared qualified type

change
  `DW_TAG_const_type`     C of C++ const qualified type
to
  `DW_TAG_const_type`     Const qualified type

add 
  `DW_TAG_immutable_type`     D Immutable type

In Table 7.3 (pg 199), add
  `DW_TAG_immutable_type`     0x4b

In Appendix A (pg 251), add 
  `DW_TAG_immutable_type`     DECL
                            `DW_AT_name`
                            `DW_AT_type`
