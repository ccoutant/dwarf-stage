Section 2.5.1.7, pg 38

If some function has arguments that are never used in the function
or which are only used in code which compiler can prove are unreachable
and the function isn't accessible from other object files (or compiler creates
a local clone of a function), then some compilers can choose not to pass
that parameter at all.  If that happens, `DW_OP_entry_value` isn't an option,
because when the argument isn't passed at all, there is no register or memory
location for it.  

Consider:

    static __attribute__((noinline)) int foo (int x, int y) { int z = x + y; return x; }

    int bar (void) { return foo (3, 17) + foo (4, 18) + foo (5, 19); }

where noinline attribute is just used to keep the example sufficiently small
to explain.  As `y` isn't stored anywhere but to a dead variable, there is no
need to pass it at all, so compiler can effectively emit

    static int foo_alt (int x) { return x; }

and call it 3 times.  

Still users might need to ask in a debugger the value
of `y` or `z` variables and it is possible to provide that value.
Unlike `DW_OP_entry_value` which can be used in debug info consumers in 2 different
ways, one is to find the caller (if possible) and if it can be found, look up
the register or memory referenced in `DW_OP_entry_value` in the
`DW_TAG_call_site_parameter`, or (mostly for non-interactive consumers) if we
know in advance we'll need `DW_OP_entry_value`, put a breakpoint at the start of
the function and collect there a value, then look up the remembered value
when evaluating `DW_OP_entry_value`, for the case of completely optimized away
arguments the latter method is not an option, there is nothing to remember
at function entry.  Still, the optimized away arguments can be found
with the former method.

The following proposal introduces a new DWARF expression Special operation
`DW_OP_parameter_ref`.

In the above testcase, `y` would have `DW_AT_location` of

    DW_OP_parameter_ref <y die> DW_OP_stack_ref

and `z` would have `DW_AT_location` of

    DW_OP_breg5 <0> DW_OP_parameter_ref <y die> DW_OP_plus DW_OP_stack_ref

(where `DW_OP_breg5 <0>` is just an example from x86\_64 how to get value of `x`).
Then, in the call sites of the 3 foo calls, one would have next to
`DW_TAG_call_site_parameter`

    DW_AT_location DW_OP_reg5 // again x86_64 example where x is passed
    DW_AT_call_value DW_OP_lit{3,4,5}
    for the call site parameter of x also
    DW_TAG_call_site_parameter
    DW_AT_call_parameter <y die>
    DW_AT_call_value DW_OP_lit{17,18,19}

Changes relative to dwarf6-20221116.pdf:

In 2.5.1.7 add:

> 3\. `DW_OP_parameter_ref`
> 
> The `DW_OP_parameter_ref` operation pushes the value that the described
> parameter would have if it was actually passed.  It has a single operand:
> In the 32-bit DWARF format, the operand is a 4-byte unsigned value; in the
> 64-bit DWARF format, it is an 8-byte unsigned value (see Section 7.4
> following).  The operand is used as the offset of a `DW_TAG_formal_parameter`
> debugging information entry in a `.debug_info` section.
> *When evaluating DW_OP_parameter_ref, the consumer can try to virtually
> unwind using the Call Frame Information (see Section 6.4 on page 174) and
> find `DW_TAG_call_site_parameter` referencing the same `DW_TAG_formal_parameter`
> debugging information entry through its `DW_AT_call_parameter` attribute.*

In 7.7.1 add to Table 7.9:

    DW_OP_parameter_ref â€¡    0xab    1   4- or 8-byte offset of DIE

In D.1.3 add to the end:

    DW_OP_parameter_ref y DW_OP_stack_value

    The values of parameter y found in DW_TAG_call_site_parameter
    of the caller with DW_AT_call_parameter referencing also parameter y.
