In order to represent defaulted member functions, we should add a
`DW_AT_defaulted` attribute.

Proposed Changes to the Spec
----------------------------

Add the following row to Table 2.2 ("Attribute names"):

    Attribute        Identifies or Specifies
    ---------        -----------------------
    `DW_AT_defaulted`  Whether a member function has been
                     declared as default

Add the following paragraph to Section 5.7.7 ("Member Function
Entries"):

    <non-normative>
    In C++, a special member function may be declared as
    defaulted, which explicitly declares a default
    compiler-generated implementation of the function. The
    declaration may have different effects on the calling
    convention used for objects of its class, depending on
    whether the default declaration is made inside or outside the
    class.
    </non-normative>

    A member function may have a `DW_AT_defaulted` attribute
    whose integer constant value indicates whether, and if so,
    how, that member is defaulted. The possible values and
    their meanings are shown in Figure xx following.

        Table xx. Defaulted Attribute Values
        Name                        Meaning
        ----                        -------
        `DW_DEFAULTED_no`             Not defaulted
        `DW_DEFAULTED_in_class`       Defaulted within the class
        `DW_DEFAULTED_out_of_class`   Defaulted outside of the class

    The absence of a `DW_AT_DEFAULTED` attribute is equivalent to
    the presence of a `DW_AT_DEFAULTED` attribute whose value is
    `DW_DEFAULTED_no`.

    <non-normative>
    An artificial member function (i.e., a compiler-generated
    copy that does not appear in the source) does not have a
    `DW_AT_defaulted` attribute.
    </non-normative>

Add the following rows to Table 7.5 ("Attribute encodings"):

    Attribute name          Value   Classes
    --------------          -----   -------
    `DW_AT_defaulted`         xxx     const

Add the following sections to Chapter 7 ("Data Representation"):

    7.X Defaulted Member Codes

    The encodings of the constants used in the `DW_AT_defaulted`
    attribute are given in Table 7.XX.

        Table 7.XX Defaulted member encodings

        Defaulted code name         Value
        -------------------         -----
        `DW_DEFAULTED_no`             0x00
        `DW_DEFAULTED_in_class`       0x01
        `DW_DEFAULTED_out_of_class`   0x02

In Appendix A, Table A.1 ("Attributes by tag value"), add
`DW_AT_defaulted` to `DW_TAG_subprogram`.
