Section 6.4.2, pg various

Three CFI instructions use DWARF expressions as operands - `DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression`, 
`DW_CFA_expression`, `DW_CFA_val_expression`.

`DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression` paragraph says that the "operand (is) encoded as a 
`DW_FORM_exprloc` value representing a DWARF expression". Note that this wording 
also eliminates a possibility for this 'exprloc' to encode a location description.

`DW_CFA(_val)_expression` paragraphs say that the operand is "a `DW_FORM_block` value 
representing a DWARF expression".

Given that all three can use only DWARF expressions (not location descriptions) - 
should `DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression` be changed so there would be a unified wording 
for all three to use `DW_FORM_block`? Moreover, page 239 says that 
`DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression` uses BLOCK (not EXPRLOC), which contradicts the 
instruction definition at the page 178.

Change seems to be backward-compatible as at the representation level both 
'block' and 'exprloc' are identical - ULEB128 length field followed by information bytes.


PROPOSED CHANGES
----------------

6.4.2.3 Register Rule Instructions

6\.  `DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression`

Replace "a `DW_FORM_exprloc`" with "an exprloc". New text:

> The `DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression` instruction takes a single operand
> encoded as an exprloc value representing a DWARF expression.


9\.  `DW_CFA_expression`

Replace "a DW_FORM_block" with "an exprloc". New text:

> The `DW_CFA_expression` instruction takes two operands: an unsigned LEB128
> value representing a register number, and an exprloc value
> representing a DWARF expression.


10\. `DW_CFA_val_expression`

Replace "a `DW_FORM_block`" with "an exprloc". New text:

> The `DW_CFA_val_expression` instruction takes two operands: an unsigned
> LEB128 value representing a register number, and an exprloc value
> representing a DWARF expression.


7.24 Call Frame Information

Table 7.29: Call frame instruction encodings

Change "BLOCK" to "exprloc" and add "register" to DW_CFA_val_expression.

New table entries:

    | DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression | 0 | 0x0f | exprloc          |              |
    | DW_CFA_expression         | 0 | 0x10 | ULEB128 register | exprloc      |
    | DW_CFA_val_expression     | 0 | 0x16 | ULEB128 register | exprloc      |
