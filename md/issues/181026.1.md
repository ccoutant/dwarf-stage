Section 3.1.3, pg 68

Currently, DW_AT_entry_pc is listed as one of the suggested attributes for a
split-full compilation unit. However, other address-related attributes are
recommended for the corresponding skeleton unit: DW_AT_low_pc, DW_AT_high_pc,
and DW_AT_ranges.

It seems peculiar to leave DW_AT_entry_pc behind, so let's not.

Textual changes:

In section 3.1.3, remove item 7 from the list, and add DW_AT_entry_pc
to the non-normative list of attributes that ought to go into the
skeleton compilation unit.


2021-08-09:  Rejected:  No reason to include DW_AT_entry_pc in split unit.
