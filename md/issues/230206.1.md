Section 6.1.1.1, pg 137

Add `DW_AT_imported_declaration` entries to name index for accelerated lookup.

Background
----------

C++ supports the ability to create aliases for namespaces.

Example — C++ namespace alias

    namespace A {                 
      namespace B {                 
	namespace C {                 
	  int a = 1;                    
	}                              
      }  // namespace B             
			      
      namespace C = B::C;           
    }  // namespace A             
			      
    int main() { return A::C::a; }

    <1> DW_TAG_namespace            
	     DW_AT_name "A"            
				
    <2>   DW_TAG_namespace          
	       DW_AT_name "B"          
				
    <3>     DW_TAG_namespace        
		  DW_AT_name "C"        
				
    <4>       DW_TAG_variable       
		    DW_AT_name "a"      
				
				
    <5>  DW_TAG_imported_declaration
	      DW_AT_import <3>         
	      DW_AT_name "C"           
                                       
In DWARF, the namespace alias “C” declared in namespace “A” is represented 
using a `DW_TAG_imported_declaration` whose name is that of the alias in the 
source program. However, compliant DWARF producers skip emitting 
`DW_TAG_import_declaration` for the namespace alias into the name index. This 
is problematic for consumers that need to perform lookup by name on the 
namespace alias (for example during LLDB’s expression evaluation) because 
there is nothing linking the import declaration and the namespace DIEs to 
each other, forcing the consumer to perform expensive scans through the 
DWARF tree or complicated bookkeeping.

This proposal extends the list of tags that may be put into the name 
index further to include `DW_TAG_import_declaration` to simplify
the work consumers have to do to find namespace alias DIEs by name.
