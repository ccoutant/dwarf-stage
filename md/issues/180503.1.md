PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Values in the LEB128 format are currently required to be minimum 
length; in some cases it may be advantageous to pad or align data 
by inserting leading zero or sign-extension bytes that don't affect 
the decoded value.

Discussion in a committee meeting revolved around whether to impose
limits on producers, or requirements on consumers.  The proposed 
change specifically does not imply that a producer could pad with 
*extra* bytes, but could simply not *remove* bytes from an ordinary
integer value; this avoids any suggestion that we could end up with
arbitrarily long LEB128 strings.

RESOLUTION

Section 7.6, pg 221, line 12, replace "be zero; discard them."
with "be zero, which may be discarded."

pg 222, line 13, add a new non-normative paragraph:

*Some producers may choose to insert padding or alignment bytes by 
retaining (not discarding) one or more high-order bytes that would 
not affect the decoded value.*
