Section 5.9, pg 98
Overview:
- Adding `DW_AT_string_length_byte_size` to describe the size of the data to be retrieved
from the location referenced by the `DW_AT_string_length` attribute.
- New interpretation to `DW_AT_byte_size` (incompatible change), to always mean the total
size allocated to hold the string data. (added non-normative text to describe both old and new behavior)

Background:
In the current spec, a string type (`DW_TAG_string_type`) may have a `DW_AT_byte_size` attribute.  
However, this attribute carries a different meaning depending on the presence of 
`DW_AT_string_length` attribute:
- if `DW_AT_string_length` is present: size of data to be retrieved from `DW_AT_string_length`
- if `DW_AT_string_length` is not present: amount of storage needed to hold a value of the string type.

Here is the description in the spec:

"The string type entry may have a `DW_AT_string_length` attribute whose value is a location 
description yielding the location where the length of the string is stored in the program. 
The string type entry may also have a `DW_AT_byte_size` attribute or `DW_AT_bit_size` attribute,
whose value (see Section 2.21) is the size of the data to be retrieved from the location 
referenced by the string length attribute. If no (byte or bit) size attribute is present, 
the size of the data to be retrieved is the same as the size of an address on the target machine.
If no string length attribute is present, the string type entry may have a `DW_AT_byte_size` 
attribute or `DW_AT_bit_size` attribute, whose value (see Section 2.21) is the amount of storage 
needed to hold a value of the string type."

Currently, there is no mechanism to have both information present on the same string type.

Proposal:
Introduce a new attribute `DW_AT_string_length_byte_size` to describe the size of the 
data (in bytes) to be retrieved from the location referenced by the `DW_AT_string_length` 
attribute.

Change the existing attribute `DW_AT_byte_size` to always indicate the total size (in bytes)
allocated to hold the string data. This is an incompatible change.

This would modify the wording to 5.9 "String Type Entries".

The string type entry may have a `DW_AT_byte_size` attribute, whose value is the amount of 
storage allocated (in bytes) to hold the string data.  The value of the attribute is 
determined as described in section 2.19.

<non-normative-text>
Prior to DWARF 5, `DW_AT_byte_size` carry different meaning depending on the presence of 
`DW_AT_string_length` attribute:
  - if `DW_AT_string_length` is present: size of data to be retrieved from `DW_AT_string_length`
  - if `DW_AT_string_length` is not present: amount of storage allocated for the string data.
In DWARF 5, this `DW_AT_byte_size` will always be used to represent the amount of storage 
allocated for the string data.
</non-normative-text>

The string type entry may have a `DW_AT_string_length` attribute whose value is a location 
description yielding the location where the actual byte length of the string is stored in 
the program. If `DW_AT_string_length` attribute is not present, the actual byte length of 
the string is assumed to be the same as the amount of storage allocated for the string 
data (i.e. the value represented by `DW_AT_byte_size`).

The string type entry may have a `DW_AT_string_length_byte_size` attribute, whose value is 
the size of the data to be retrieved from the location referenced by the `DW_AT_string_length` 
attribute. If `DW_AT_string_length_byte_size` attribute is not present, the size of the data 
to be retrieved is the same as the size of an address on the target machine. 

Use cases:

1) plain string type with 10 bytes allocated for the string
| .......... |
|
start of string content

existing DWARF:
`DW_TAG_string_type`
  `DW_AT_byte_size` (10)
  
proposed DWARF:
`DW_TAG_string_type`
  `DW_AT_byte_size` (10)

2) two byte prefix length string, with no pre-defined allocated maximum
| xxxx | ... |
  |      |
  |      start of string content
  2 byte length prefix

existing DWARF:
`DW_TAG_string_type`
  `DW_AT_string_length` (`DW_OP_push_object_address`)
  `DW_AT_byte_size` (2)
  `DW_AT_data_location` (`DW_OP_push_object_address` `DW_OP_plus_uconst` 2)
  
proposed DWARF:
`DW_TAG_string_type`
  `DW_AT_string_length` (`DW_OP_push_object_address`)
  `DW_AT_string_length_byte_size` (2)
  `DW_AT_data_location` (`DW_OP_push_object_address` `DW_OP_plus_uconst` 2)
  ! no `DW_AT_byte_size` since no pre-defined maximum allocation


3) two byte prefix length string, with 10 bytes allocated for the string
| xxxx | .......... |
  |      |
  |      start of string content (10 bytes max)
  2 byte length prefix

existing DWARF:
`DW_TAG_string_type`
  `DW_AT_string_length` (`DW_OP_push_object_address`)
  `DW_AT_byte_size` (2)
  `DW_AT_data_location` (`DW_OP_push_object_address` `DW_OP_plus_uconst` 2)
  
proposed DWARF:
`DW_TAG_string_type`
  `DW_AT_string_length` (`DW_OP_push_object_address`)
  `DW_AT_string_length_byte_size` (2)
  `DW_AT_data_location` (`DW_OP_push_object_address` `DW_OP_plus_uconst` 2)
  `DW_AT_byte_size` (10)
  
4) String via dope vector  
| xxxxxxxx | addr of string |
             | 
             -> | .................... |
                  |
                  start of string content (allocated 20 bytes)

existing DWARF:
`DW_TAG_string_type`
  `DW_AT_string_length` (`DW_OP_push_object_address`)
  `DW_AT_byte_size` (4)
  `DW_AT_data_location` (`DW_OP_push_object_address` `DW_OP_plus_uconst` 4 `DW_OP_deref`)
  
proposed DWARF:
`DW_TAG_string_type`
  `DW_AT_string_length` (`DW_OP_push_object_address`)
  `DW_AT_string_length_byte_size` (4)
  `DW_AT_data_location` (`DW_OP_push_object_address` `DW_OP_plus_uconst` 4 `DW_OP_deref`)
  `DW_AT_byte_size` (20)
