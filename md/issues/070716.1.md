PROPOSAL: `DW_AT_high_pc` encoded as a constant offset from the `DW_AT_low_pc`

Background:

Currently, an entity with the `DW_AT_low_pc` and `DW_AT_high_pc` attributes will end
p up with one relocation entry for each.  For example:

   `DW_AT_low_pc`  -> somefunction
   `DW_AT_high_pc` -> somefunction+350

or:

   `DW_AT_low_pc`  -> somefunction
   `DW_AT_high_pc` -> `.somefunction_end`


Proposal:

This could be reduced to a single relocation entry by allowing the `DW_AT_high_pc`
attribute to be encoded as a constant offset from the `DW_AT_low_pc`.  For
example:

   `DW_AT_low_pc`  -> somefunction
   `DW_AT_high_pc` -> 350

or:

   `DW_AT_low_pc`  -> somefunction
   `DW_AT_high_pc` -> `.somefunction_end` - somefunction (resolvable by the asm)

This was motivated by a desire to use this new encoding in the `DW_TAG_frame_info`
in the "CFI with abbrevs" proposal, but it seems generally useful, too.

Wording changes:

2.17.2:

When the set of addresses of a debugging information entry can be described as a
single contiguous range, the entry may have a `DW_AT_low_pc` and `DW_AT_high_pc`
pair of attributes. The value of the `DW_AT_low_pc` attribute is the relocated
address of the first instruction associated with the entity.  The value of the
`DW_AT_high_pc` attribute represents the first location past the last instruction
associated with the entity.  It is either the relocated address of that
location, or is a constant number of addressable units which, when added to the
`DW_AT_low_pc` value, produces that relocated address.

*The location represented by the high PC value may be beyond the last valid
instruction in the executable.*
