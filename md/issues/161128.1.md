Section D.1.3, pg 288
There are currently no examples of how to correctly use DW_OP_bit_piece.
I recently discovered that I mis-implemented DW_OP_bit_piece in LLVM and I believe that
having and example like the following would have helped avoid this.

I suggest adding the following example to D.1.3 (DWARF Location Description Examples):

"
DW_OP_reg0 DW_OP_bit_piece 1 31 DW_OP_bit_piece 7 0 DW_OP_reg1 DW_OP_piece 1

A variable whose first bit resides in the 31st bit of register 0, whose next 
seven bits are undefined and whose second byte resides in register 1.
