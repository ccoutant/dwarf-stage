Section 7, pg 188
In order to be more specific with respect to endianness etc how about we use 
"least significant" rather than "lower" for the MD5 hash.

Once the string S has been formed from the DWARF encoding, an MD5 hash is computed for 
the string and the lower 64 bits are taken as the type signature
