Section 7, pg 188
In order to be more specific with respect to endianness etc how about we use 
"least significant" rather than "lower" for the MD5 hash.

Change:

Once the string S has been formed from the DWARF encoding, an MD5 hash is computed for 
the string and the lower 64 bits are taken as the type signature
