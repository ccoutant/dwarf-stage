Sec 6.4.2.2.  pdf page 133, acroread page 147.

The content of point 6 is odd.

6. The DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset_sf instruction takes a signed LEB128 
   operand representing a factored offset. This instruction is 
   identical to DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset except that the operand is 
   signed and factored. The resulting offset is factored_offset * 
   data_alignment_factor.DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression 
   The DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression instruction takes a single operand 
   encoded as a DW_FORM_exprloc value representing a DWARF expression. 
   The required action is to establish that expression as the means 
   by which the current CFA

It seems that point 5 content got jammed into point 6 somehow.  

This seemingly happened in adding explicit calculations to the description of point 5.  

And 6.4.3.3:
pdf page 134,  acroread page 148.

The content of point  6 gets separated out into point 7.

6. DW_CFA_val_offset
7. The DW_CFA_val_offset instruction takes two unsigned LEB128 operands 
   representing a register number and a factored offset. The required 
   action is to change the rule for the register indicated by the register 
   number to be a val_offset(N) rule where the value of N is factored_offset 
   * data_alignment_factor.
