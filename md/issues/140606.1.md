Section 3.1.1.3, pg 45
Julia (http://julialang.org/) is a programming language aimed at scientific
computing (though general purpose) that has been gaining popularity lately. 
We now have the ability to generate DWARF debug info for both JIT debugging 
and in emitting native code. I would like to suggest adding an official 
DW_AT_language identifier for debug info generated by julia.
