Section 6.1.1, pg 136
The last line of page 136 uses the words
"index that covers the entire load module"

Replace "load module" by 
"executable or shared object".

The phrase "load module" does not
appear anywhere else in the document.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Delete (rather than replace) the word "load". In this context "the entire module" is
sufficiently clear.
