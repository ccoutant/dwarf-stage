Section 7.12, pg 173

Request a new language tag DW_LANG_Modula3 = 0x0017 for the Modula-3 programming language, which is materially
different from Modula-2.  Some example differences include object-oriented types, both garbage-collected and
explicitly deallocated heaps, builtin thread support, an extremely flexible system for selective
information hiding about types, and complete type safety by default, which can be selectivley weakened 
when necessary.

See http://modula3.elegosoft.com/cm3/doc/reference/complete/html/Modula_3_Language_definitio.html

The actual value, of course, does not matter, but it is my understanding that 0x0017 is the next available.
