 Background
----------------

Memory segmentation was originally implemented by Intel for their x86
instruction set back in the 1978 as a way to allow programs to address
more than 64 KB of memory.

DW_AT_segment attribute was originally introduced in DWARF version 2
as a way to support architectures which addresses are specified as
offsets in a given segment rather than as a location within single
flat address space.

An additional support for the memory segmentation model was added in
DWARF version 5 in a form of a segment selector, to allow segmented
addresses to be used in all DWARF sections that reference a memory
address.

However, for the last 19 years, Intel has not exposed this hardware
feature to the user and it is mostly used implicitly by the instruction
set or described by other means (TLS).

There is also no other known vendor that currently exposes this feature
to the users, leaving the memory segment support potentially unneeded.

Additional confirmation to this claim, is the fact that widely used
producer (clang) and consumers (gdb and lldb) never had a support for
the DW_AT_segment attribute implemented.

There was the idea to re-purpose the memory segmentation concept to
describe address spaces of some architectures (for example SIMD/SIMT),
but the problem is that those two concepts are not similar enough and
representing address spaces requires a finer level of granularity
compared to the DIE level that DW_AT_segment attribute prescribes.

Cleaner (and less confusing) approach would be to just remove the
memory segmentation support from the standard completely, to leave
room for the new concepts.

To avoid increasing the versions of the affected DWARF section headers,
the previously introduced segment_selector_size header value is marked
as reserved with a default value of 0.

It is worth mentioning here that even though the DW_AT_address_class
attribute was introduced alongside the DW_AT_segment attribute, there
are existing architectures  (Atmel AVR and FTDI FT32 32-bit for
example) that are using (or misusing) that attribute to represent address
space like features. Together with the fact that SIMD/SIMT architectures
require a similar mechanism too, it would be reasonable to keep the
attribute as is.

Proposed Change
------------------------

In section 1.3.2, "Architecture Independence",  p. 3, line 20, replace
the first sentence of the first paragraph:

  "DWARF can be used with a wide range of processor architectures,
   whether byte or word oriented, linear or segmented, with any
   word or byte size."

with text:

  "DWARF can be used with a wide range of processor architectures,
   whether byte or word oriented, with any word or byte size."

In section 1.3.2, "Architecture Independence",  p. 3, line 27, replace
the paragraph:

  "DWARF assumes that memory has individual units (words or bytes)
   which have unique addresses which are ordered. (Some architectures
   like the i386 can represent the same physical machine location with
   different segment and offset pairs. Identifying aliases is an
   implementation issue.)"
   
with text:

  "DWARF assumes that memory has individual units (words or bytes)
   which have unique addresses which are ordered. (Identifying aliases
   is an implementation issue.)"

In section 2.2, "Attribute types", p. 22, remove DW_AT_segment row from
the table 2.2 "Attribute names".

In section 2.12, "Segmented Address", p 48, line 1, change section name
to "Address Classes"

On the same page, line 2 remove first three paragraphs.

At line 25, remove the Intel 386 example along with the Table 2.7
"Example address class codes".

In section 3.3.3, "Subroutine and Entry Point Locations", p. 78,
line 27 replace the paragraph:

  "Subroutines and entry points may also have DW_AT_segment and
   DW_AT_address_class attributes, as appropriate, to specify which
   segments the code for the subroutine resides in and the addressing
   mode to be used in calling that subroutine."

with text:

  "Subroutines and entry points may also have DW_AT_address_class
   attribute, to specify in which address space the code for the
   subroutine resides in."

In section 3.3.8.1, "Abstract Instances", p. 82, line 21, replace the
paragraph:

  "For example, the DW_AT_low_pc, DW_AT_high_pc, DW_AT_ranges,
   DW_AT_entry_pc, DW_AT_location, DW_AT_return_addr, DW_AT_start_scope,
   and DW_AT_segment attributes typically should be omitted; however,
   this list is not exhaustive."
   
with text:

  "For example, the DW_AT_low_pc, DW_AT_high_pc, DW_AT_ranges,
   DW_AT_entry_pc, DW_AT_location, DW_AT_return_addr and
   DW_AT_start_scope attributes typically should be omitted; however,
   this list is not exhaustive."

In section 4.1, "Data Object Entries", p. 98, line 15, remove the
paragraph.

In section 5.1.1.2, "Character Encodings", p. 105, remove the section
2.12 reference at the end of the table 5.1.

Replace segment_selector_size value description for all section headers
with text:

  "Reserved to DWARF (must be zero)."

Sections that are impacted by the change are:
  - 6.1.2, "Lookup by Address", p. 148, line 7,
  - 6.2.4, "The Line Number Program Header", p 154, line 16,
  - 6.4.1, "Structure of Call Frame Information", p 175, line 5,
  - 7.21, "Address Range Table", p 235, lines 23,
  - 7.27, "Address Table", p 241, lines 23,
  - 7.28, "Range List Table", p 242. line 16 and
  - 7.29, "Location List Table", p 243, line 23.

Similarly, the address_size value description also needs to be changed
for all section headers. The problem is that the description text
deviates from a section to section:

  1. In section 6.1.2 "Lookup by Address", p 148, line 4, replace the
     paragraph:

       "4. address_size (ubyte)
           The size of an address in bytes on the target architecture.
           For segmented addressing, this is the size of the offset
           portion of the address."

     with text:

       "4. address_size (ubyte)
           The size of an address in bytes on the target architecture."
         
  2. In sections:
         - 6.2.4, "The Line Number Program Header", p 154, line 10,
         - 7.21, "Address Range Table", p 235 lines 20,
         - 7.27, "Address Table", p 241, line 20,
         - 7.28, "Range List Table", p 242, line 13 and
         - 7.29, "Location List Table", p 243, lines 20.

     replace the sentence:
 
       "A 1-byte unsigned integer containing the size in bytes of
        an address (or offset portion of an address for segmented
        addressing) on the target system."
         
     with text:
 
       "A 1-byte unsigned integer containing the size in bytes of
        an address on the target system."

  3. In sections:
         - 7.5.1.1, "Full and Partial Compilation Unit Headers",
           p 200, line 22,
         - 7.5.1.2, "Skeleton and Split Compilation Unit Headers".
           p 201 line 22 and
         - 7.5.1.3, "Type Unit Headers", p 202, lines 21.
 
     replace paragraph:
 
       "4. address_size (ubyte)
           A 1-byte unsigned integer representing the size in bytes of
           an address on the target architecture. If the system uses
           segmented addressing, this value represents the size of the
           offset portion of an address."

     with text:

       "4. address_size (ubyte)
           A 1-byte unsigned integer representing the size in bytes of
           an address on the target architecture."
       
In section 6.1.2 "Lookup by Address", p 148, line 10, replace the
paragraph:

   "This header is followed by a variable number of address range
    descriptors. Each descriptor is a triple consisting of a segment
    selector, the beginning address within that segment of a range of
    text or data covered by some entry owned by the corresponding
    compilation unit, followed by the non-zero length of that range.
    A particular set is terminated by an entry consisting of three
    zeroes. When the segment_selector_size value is zero in the header,
    the segment selector is omitted so that each descriptor is just a
    pair, including the terminating entry. By scanning the table, a
    debugger can quickly decide which compilation unit to look in to
    find the debugging information for an object that has a given
    address."
   
with text:

   "This header is followed by a variable number of address range

    quickly decide which compilation unit to look in to find the
    debugging information for an object that has a given address."

In section 6.4.1, "Structure of Call Frame Information", p 176, line 1
replace paragraph:

   "3. initial_location (segment selector and target address)
       The address of the first location associated with this table
       entry. If the segment_selector_size field of this FDE’s CIE is
       non-zero, the initial location is preceded by a segment selector
       of the given length."

with text:

   "3. initial_location (target address)
       The address of the first location associated with this table
       entry."

In section 6.4.2.1, "Row Creation Instructions", p 177, line 2 replace
paragraph:

   "1. DW_CFA_set_loc
       The DW_CFA_set_loc instruction takes a single operand that
       represents a target address. The required action is to create a
       new table row using the specified address as the location. All
       other values in the new row are initially identical to the
       current row. The new location value is always greater than the
       current one. If the segment_selector_size field of this FDE’s
       CIE is non-zero, the initial location is preceded by a segment
       selector of the given length."

with text:

   "1. DW_CFA_set_loc

In section 7.5.4, "Attribute Encodings" p 210 remove DW_AT_segment row
from Table 7.5 "Attribute encodings".
 
In section 7.21, "Address Range Table", p 235 line 26 replace paragraph:

   "This header is followed by a series of tuples. Each tuple consists
    of a segment, an address and a length. The segment selector size is
    given by the segment_selector_size field of the header; the address
    and length size are each given by the address_size field of the
    header. The first tuple following the header in each set begins at
    an offset that is a multiple of the size of a single tuple (that
    is, the size of a segment selector plus twice the size of an
    address). The header is padded, if necessary, to that boundary.
    Each set of tuples is terminated by a 0 for the segment, a 0 for
    the address and 0 for the length. If the segment_selector_size
    field in the header is zero, the segment selectors are omitted from
    all tuples, including the terminating tuple."
   
with text:

   "This header is followed by a series of pairs. Each pair consists of
    an address and a length. The address and length size are each given
    by the address_size field of the header. The first pair following
    the header in each set begins at an offset that is a multiple of
    the size of a single pair (that is twice the size of an address).
    The header is padded, if necessary, to that boundary. Each set of
    pairs is terminated by a 0 for the address and 0 for the length."

In section 7.27, "Address Table", p 241, line 26 replace paragraph:

   "This header is followed by a series of segment/address pairs. The
    segment size is given by the segment_selector_size field of the
    header, and the address size is given by the address_size field of
    the header. If the segment_selector_size field in the header is
    zero, the entries consist only of an addresses."

with text:

   "This header is followed by a series of addresses where the address
    size is given by the address_size field of the header."
 
In section 7.28, "Range List Table" (page 243) line 1 remove paragraph:

   "The segment size is given by the segment_selector_size field of the
    header, and the address size is given by the address_size field of
    the header. If the segment_selector_size field in the header is
    zero, the segment selector is omitted from the range list entries."

In section 7.29, "Location List Table", p 244, line 7 remove paragraph:

   "The segment size is given by the segment_selector_size field of the
    header, and the address size is given by the address_size field of
    the header. If the segment_selector_size field in the header is
    zero, the segment selector is omitted from location list entries."
