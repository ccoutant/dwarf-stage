Section 7.28,7.29, pg 242,244

Both 7.28 (Range List Table) and 7.29 (Location List Table) mention, in a 
non-normative comment:

> "[use of rnglistx] is necessary in split units and may be more compact than 
> using `DW_FORM_sec_offset` in non-split units"

But figure B.2 (page 278, explained on page 280) says that `DW_FORM_sec_offset` 
may be used to reference `.debug_rnglists.dwo` from `.debug_info.dwo`.

I think the latter is correct & the former non-normative comments should be 
removed/amended.
