Section 1.4, pg 3

In DWARF3 DW_AT_high_pc had only a single class, address. In DWARF4 it 
can now be an address or constant. This can be used to specify a low pc 
of 0x1000 and a high pc of 0x80 (meaning 0x1080) and whilst this is 
specified in section 2.17.2 it doesn't seem to have made it to the list 
of changes. I think this produces an incompatible change as DWARF 
version 3 consumers will see a high pc lower than the low pc.
