Section 7.3.2.2, pg 189
Amend the text adopted for 211102.1 slightly, to future-proof it.
Take the explicit enumeration of disallowed forms etc., and make
those for-example instead.

Section 7.3.2.2, p.189

Adopted text from 211102.1:

  Direct reference using form DW_FORM_strp or 
  DW_FORM_strp8, as well as the macro entries 
  DW_MACRO_define_strp or DW_MACRO_undef_strp, 
  is not allowed.

Proposed text:

  Direct reference (e.g., using form DW_FORM_strp or 
  DW_FORM_strp8, or the macro entries 
  DW_MACRO_define_strp or DW_MACRO_undef_strp)
  is not allowed.

That is, wrap the middle of the sentence with (e.g., ... ) 
to emphasize that it is _direct reference_ that is prohibited,
and these are some of the things that do direct references.
Also replace "as well as" with "or" to make it read better
in the "for example" context.
