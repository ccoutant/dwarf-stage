Section 7.3.2.2, pg 189
Amend the text adopted for 211102.1 slightly, to future-proof it.
Take the explicit enumeration of disallowed forms etc., and make
those for-example instead.

Section 7.3.2.2, p.189

Adopted text from 211102.1:

  Direct reference using form `DW_FORM_strp` or 
  DW_FORM_strp8, as well as the macro entries 
  `DW_MACRO_define_strp` or `DW_MACRO_undef_strp`, 
  is not allowed.

Proposed text:

  Direct reference (e.g., using form `DW_FORM_strp` or 
  DW_FORM_strp8, or the macro entries 
  `DW_MACRO_define_strp` or `DW_MACRO_undef_strp`)
  is not allowed.

That is, wrap the middle of the sentence with (e.g., ... ) 
to emphasize that it is _direct reference_ that is prohibited,
and these are some of the things that do direct references.
Also replace "as well as" with "or" to make it read better
in the "for example" context.
