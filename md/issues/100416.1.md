Thread:
[Dwarf-Discuss] Attribute as reference uses target DIE value or address?
http://lists.dwarfstd.org/private.cgi/dwarf-discuss-dwarfstd.org/2010-April/000844.html

# - For a reference, the value is a reference to another entity which specifies
# the value of the attribute.

It could more clearly state if only DW_TAG_variable (or also DW_TAG_constant and 
others?) could be referenced and if its read out value (and not the location) gets 
used as the attribute value.

# - For an exprloc, the value is interpreted as a DWARF expression or location
# description; evaluation of the expression yields the value of the attribute.

It should omit "or location description".

Second proposed change accepted.
