Section 6.2.4, 6.2.5, pg 115

Issue 130701.1 adds a fixed file_entry_format (ubyte) field that just allows one attribute 
(group) to be defined. Which isn't vendor extensible. Instead of such a fixed file attribute 
I propose to adopt the approach of the .debug_macro proposal 110722.1 to make the attributes 
attached to a file entry producer described to allow extending the number of attributes in 
later DWARF versions or as vendor extensions and give consumers a way to skip over
any unknown attributes.

Add the following to Section 6.2.4 "The Line Number Program Header" based on the text in 
Issue 130701.1:

file_attributes (ubyte)
  - Possibly zero, number of attributes added to each file in the
    file_names table.
file_attribute_description (sequence of attribute descriptions)
  - Entries in this description describe which attributes and in what
    format those attributes are encoded for each file entry. It has
    file_attributes entries. Each entry consists of:
    - file_attribute (ubyte). One of DW_LNF_timestamp,
      DW_LNF_length, DW_LNF_MD5, ...
    - file_attribute_format. A uleb128 describing the number of
      arguments for the format followed a single byte describing the
      form of the argument. The allowed values are DW_FORM_data1,
      DW_FORM_data2, DW_FORM_data4, DW_FORM_data8, DW_FORM_sdata, DW_FORM_udata,
      DW_FORM_block, DW_FORM_block1, DW_FORM_block2, DW_FORM_block4, DW_FORM_flag,
      DW_FORM_string, DW_FORM_strp and DW_FORM_sec_offset.

file_names (sequence of file entries)
  - Each entry consists of the following values:
    - A null-terminated string containing the full or relative path name
      of a source file.
    - An unsigned LEB128 number representing the directory index of a
      directory in the include_directories section.
    - For each file_attribute_format described in the
      file_attribute_description entries the value encoded in the format
      given by file_attribute_format.

For example DW_LNF_timestamp and DW_LNF_length would have as format 1
DW_FORM_udata. DW_LNF_MD5 could by described by 2 DW_FORM_data8.

The constants as defined and used in Issue 130701.1 can be reused in the above.
