Currently both GCC and GDB do not generate/assume inheritance of
`DW_AT_declaration` through `DW_AT_specification`.  It was discussed at:
http://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2004-04/threads.html#00296

And it is implemented in GDB by `die_is_declaration`():
http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/src/gdb/dwarf2read.c?cvsroot=src

But the DWARF spec says:
*Debugging information entries with a `DW_AT_specification`
  attribute do not need to duplicate information provided by the
  debugging information entry referenced by that specification
  attribute.*

Therefore the DIE completing former non-defining DIE should override 
its `DW_AT_declaration` by explicit `DW_AT_declaration`=0 to have its meaning
currently read by GDB.

Current DIEs:
 &lt;3&gt;&lt;247&gt;: Abbrev Number: 18 (`DW_TAG_variable`)
    &lt;248&gt;   `DW_AT_name`        : cX
    &lt;24b&gt;   `DW_AT_decl_file`   : 1
    &lt;24c&gt;   `DW_AT_decl_line`   : 109
    &lt;24d&gt;   `DW_AT_type`        : &lt;0xca&gt;
    &lt;251&gt;   `DW_AT_declaration` : 1

 &lt;1&gt;&lt;5c5&gt;: Abbrev Number: 37 (`DW_TAG_variable`)
    &lt;5c6&gt;   `DW_AT_specification`: &lt;0x247&gt;
    &lt;5ca&gt;   `DW_AT_const_value` : 6

IMO according to the current DWARF spec there is missing:
    &lt;5cb&gt;   `DW_AT_declaration` : 0

That `DW_AT_declaration` is not being inherited through `DW_AT_specification`
may be implied by the DWARF specification but it is not clear enough to me.

Please update the DWARF standard to say it explicitely:
*`DW_AT_declaration` and `DW_AT_sibling` attributes are not being
  inherited from the debugging information entry referenced by
  the specification attribute.*

Accepted with modifications. 

Add following text 2.13.2:
 
    *It is not the case that all the attributes of the debugging information entry
    referenced by a `DW_AT_specification` attribute apply to the referring debugging
    information entry.*
