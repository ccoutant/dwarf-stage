Section 1.4, pg 8
In 1.4 we list:
"The compilation unit header (in the `.debug_info` section) has a new
`unit_type` field."

this isn't precise, not only the `unit_type` field has been added, but the
`debug_abbrev_offset` and `address_size` fields were swapped in DWARF5 compared
to DWARF4 (and padding1/padding2 were added, I hope we can still remove them
again).

"A location list entry with the address range (0, maximum-address) is
defined as the new default location list entry"

looks to be from before `.debug_loclists` got accepted, default location
list entry is now just `DW_LLE_default_location` entry.  So I think we
should remove this bullet.

On the other hand, `DW_FORM_sec_offset` on attributes with loclist class
(like `DW_AT_location`) or rnglist class (like `DW_AT_ranges`) are actually
incompatible (and thus should be listed as such), their meaning changes
depending on the version field in corresponding `.debug_info` section,
in DWARF4 it meant offsets into `.debug_loc`/`.debug_ranges` sections, while
in DWARF5 it means offsets into `.debug_loclists`/`.debug_rnglists` sections.
So it isn't similar to `.debug_macinfo` vs. `.debug_macro`, because in that
case it is referred by a different attribute.
