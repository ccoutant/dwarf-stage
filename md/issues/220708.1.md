Section B.2, pg 278
Context:
  Page 280 describes the (fo) link is described as "The operand of the 
`DW_OP_call_ref` DWARF expression operator is the offset of a debugging 
information entry in the `debug_info`.dwo section of another compilation 
unit. Similar for attribute operands that use `DW_FORM_ref_addr`."

Problem:
  From http://lists.dwarfstd.org/private.cgi/dwarf-workgroup-dwarfstd.org/2021-May/001100.html

  "I think the (fo) link is not possible right now (there's no way to 
  compute cross-CU references currently, they would require the packaging 
  tool to fixup the offsets, which is an anti-goal) - 
  http://lists.dwarfstd.org/pipermail/dwarf-discuss-dwarfstd.org/2017-May/004349.html 
  for more context on that."

It's also unclear how two CUs would be produced in a single DWO (to allow 
a cross-unit reference between them to be produced, ignoring how that would 
be handled during packaging/DWP creation).

Proposed Resolution:
  Remove (fo) from Figure B.2 and the associated list of edge descriptions
  that follows/is part of the figure.
