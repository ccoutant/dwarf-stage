Section 2.18 Entry Address, pg 40
Background:

Currently, an DIE with a `DW_AT_entry_pc` and a `DW_AT_ranges` will create
multiple relocatable addresses for both the `DW_AT_entry_pc` and the
`DW_AT_ranges`. For example:

In `.debug_info`

`DW_TAG_subroutine`
  `DW_AT_entry_pc` (addr) 0x403a9e <func+0x1e>
  `DW_AT_ranges` (`sec_offset`) range list [    50]

In `.debug_ranges`

[50] 0x403a9e <`some_func`+0x1e>..0x403aa4 <`some_func`+0x24>
     0x403abb <`some_func`+0x3b>..0x403abf <`some_func`+0x3f>

Often, as in this example, the `entry_pc` is equal to the first range
address.

Proposal:

Since `DW_AT_entry_pc` is often the same, or an offset from, the
first range list address, it can be encoded as a constant offset
from the `DW_AT_low_pc` address or the first `DW_AT_ranges` address.

Wording changes:

2.18 Entry Address

Remove the '.' the end of the sentence "The value of the
`DW_AT_entry_pc` attribute is a relocated address" and add "if the
value of `DW_AT_entry_pc` is of class address; or if it is of class
constant, the value is an unsigned integer offset which, when
added to the base address of the function, gives the entry
address. The base address of the function is given by either the
`DW_AT_low_pc` attribute, or the first range entry in the list of
ranges given by the `DW_AT_ranges` attribute."

Figure 20. Attribute encodings, begins here.

Change the entry for `DW_AT_entry_pc` to read:

`DW_AT_entry_pc`   0x52   address, constant
