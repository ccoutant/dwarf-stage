Re: Section 5.3, Page 63

5.3 defines `DW_TAG_mutable_type` for "C++ mutable qualified type".
There are no C++ mutable qualified types.  'mutable' is a modifier
on aggregate members and its behavior is closer to the visibility
attributes such as 'private'.  There are no 'mutable T' types
any more than there are 'private T' types.  In C++ such issues of
whether types are or aren't the same are often crucial, and need
careful reading of the C++ standard.

In the following
  class S { T x; mutable T y; };
x and y have the same type, and their DIEs should reference the
same (or at least identical) type DIE.

Mutability can be indicated by a defining a flag attribute for
`DW_TAG_member` DIEs.

PROPOSAL:

Add an attribute called `DW_AT_mutable` with a flag value that
can be used in a `DW_TAG_member` die.

   In 5.6.6 add a new paragraph 3 (after the `DW_AT_accessibilty` description)

   The data member will have a `DW_AT_mutable` attribute with
   the value true if that member was marked with the
   mutable keyword in the source.

   Add `DW_AT_mutable` to the list next to `DW_TAG_member` in Appendix A.

   Add `DW_AT_mutable` to the list of attributes in 2.2 with the
   description:  "Member declared mutable"

   Add `DW_AT_mutable` to Figure 19 (Attribute Encodings)
   with a suggested number of 0x61

Remove all mention `DW_TAG_mutable_type` from the standard,
but leave it's number allocated.  I found 5 occurrences
listed here:

   Remove `DW_TAG_mutable_type` from the list of tag names
   (Figure 1) in section 2.1.

   Remove `DW_TAG_mutable_type` from section 5.3 (Figure 14)

   Remove `DW_TAG_mutable_type` from Appendix A (Figure 17)
   (Make sure not to reassign the number 0x3e to another tag.
    Perhaps we should leave the table entry in there with
    an "unused" marker in place of `DW_TAG_mutable_type`.

   Remove the row in Figure 40 that describes `DW_TAG_mutable_type`

   Remove the index entry for `DW_TAG_mutable_type`.
