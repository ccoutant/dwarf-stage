Section 2.6.1, pg 39

Section 2.6.1 "Single Location Descriptions" item 2 is about
composite location descriptions (p.39 lines 5-10).  It ends
with this sentence:

>   Each simple location description that is a DWARF expression
>   is evaluated independently of any others.

"That is a DWARF expression"? This qualification immediately
makes me wonder, are non-DWARF-expression simple location
descriptions evaluated dependently?

I think not; I think all of them are independent.  That
independence may be _relevant_ only for DWARF expressions,
but I think the idea is that a consumer could split up the
composite location description into its pieces and evaluate
them in whatever order it pleases.

Suggested edit: Remove "that is a DWARF expression" from
the quoted sentence.
