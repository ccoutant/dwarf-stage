Section 3.2.5, pg 74

In sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4, DW_AT_import is described as a
reference to the debugging information *entry* to be imported.
However, in section 3.2.5, the wording is "a reference to the
normal or partial compilation unit whose declarations logically
belong at the place of the imported unit entry."

I think this is ambiguous; I expect the intent is that it is
a reference to the unit *entry* to be imported, but could be
interpreted as being a reference to the unit *header* for the
unit to be imported.  If we simply add the word "entry" after
the word "unit" then the ambiguity goes away, and the meaning
of DW_AT_import is consistent across all uses.


Specific change:

p.74 line 21, "partial unit whose declarations" should become
"partial unit entry whose declarations" (insert "entry").

(If my interpretation is incorrect, or contrary to existing
practice in compilers for languages that do this kind of import,
then we should instead be explicit about DW_AT_import being a 
unit-header reference, and change "reference to the normal or 
partial compilation unit" to be "reference to the header of the 
normal or partial compilation unit" (inserting "the header of")).
