Microsoft has a symbol server protocol that is trivial to implement and 
they have published a specification for ELF files and their sym files as well.

Please look here.

https://github.com/dotnet/symstore/blob/master/docs/specs/SSQP_Key_Conventions.md#elf-buildid

This will allow debuggers to download the ELF and SYM files based on the 
buildid.

If GCC implements this we will bring modern development and debugging to the 
Linux platform as well.
