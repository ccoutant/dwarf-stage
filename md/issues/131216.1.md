Section 2.13.1, pg 35
The current text reads:

"A debugging information entry that represents a non-defining or non-defining
declaration otherwise incomplete declaration of a program entity has a
DW_AT_declaration attribute, which is a flag"

it should probably read:

"A debugging information entry that represents a non-defining or otherwise 
incomplete declaration of a program entity has a DW_AT_declaration attribute, 
which is a flag..."
