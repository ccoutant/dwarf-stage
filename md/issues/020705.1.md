In section 6.4.2, "Call Frame Instructions":

Could the DW_CFA_ instructions be grouped according to their function,
rather than their numeric value?  I think presenting things this way
makes it much clearer what variants of each instruction are available,
and also shows that the instruction set isn't really that complicated.

The disadvantage is that it's harder to check the text against the
list of numeric values in Chapter 7.

DW_CFA_set_loc
DW_CFA_advance_loc
DW_CFA_advance_loc1
DW_CFA_advance_loc2
DW_CFA_advance_loc4

DW_CFA_def_cfa
DW_CFA_def_cfa_sf
DW_CFA_def_cfa_register
DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset
DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset_sf
DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression

DW_CFA_undefined

DW_CFA_same_value

DW_CFA_offset
DW_CFA_offset_extended
DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf

DW_CFA_register

DW_CFA_expression

DW_CFA_restore
DW_CFA_restore_extended

DW_CFA_remember_state
DW_CFA_restore_state

DW_CFA_nop
