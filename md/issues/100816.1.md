Section 6.1.2, pg 107

In section 6.1.2 of the DWARF3 spec. the debug_info_offset was defined as:
 
  "3.  debug_info_offset (section offset)
 
   The offset from the beginning of the .debug_info section of the 
   compilation unit header referenced by the set."
  
However in section 6.1.2 of the DWARF4 spec. the definition has been changed to:
  
  "3.  debug_info_offset (section offset)
  
   The offset from the beginning of the .debug_info or .debug_types 
   section of the compilation unit header referenced by the set."
 
However there doesn't appear to be any obvious way of determing whether the 
offset is into the .debug_info section or the .debug_types section.   As the 
entries .debug_types are not expected to have addresses the reference to 
.debug_types in this sentence should be removed.

Accepted with modification:  Remove "or .debug_types".
