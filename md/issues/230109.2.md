Section 2.5.1.7, pg 38

As has been discussed in `DW_AT_default_value` discussions, it might
be useful to be able to call a user function during evaluation of
DWARF expressions, pass it arguments popped from the DWARF stack
and push the return value which was returned back on DWARF stack.

Most debuggers already have the possibility to invoke inferior calls,
and especially for calls which don't have side-effects on global memory
it might be useful to arrange for such calls during computation of value
of some optimized out variables.

Say, if one has:

    #include <math.h>
    void foo (float x) { float f = sqrtf (x) * 4.0f; }

if the debug info producer decides to optimize away the call because
it isn't really used afterwards (and user tells that e.g. floating point
exceptions aren't important), then currently there is nothing that can
describe the value of variable `f`, while in debugger one can

    print sqrtf (x) * 4.0f

and get the value.

Changes relative to dwarf6-20221116.pdf:

In 2.5.1.7 add:

> 4\. `DW_OP_call_value`
> 
>    The `DW_OP_call_value` operation pushes the value that a function return.
>    It has three operands, the first is an unsigned LEB128 integer that represents
>    the offset of a debugging information entry in the current compilation unit,
>    or value 0 which represents the generic type.  If the first operand is non-zero,
>    the referenced entry must be a `DW_TAG_base_type` entry that provides the type to
>    which the returned value is converted.
> 
>    The second operand is in the 32-bit DWARF a 4-byte unsigned value,
>    in the 64-bit DWARF format an 8-byte unsigned value, which is the offset
>    of a `DW_TAG_subprogram` debugging information entry in a `.debug_info` section
>    for a function to be called.  The third operand is an unsigned ULEB128
>    number of arguments.  The `DW_OP_call_value` operation pops that number of
>    entries from the stack, constructs a call to the specified function with
>    the popped entries as argument values (the first popped entry (topmost)
>    being the first argument, executes the function and pushes the value
>    the function returned converted to the type indicated by the first operand.

In 7.7.1 add to Table 7.9:

    DW_OP_call_value â€¡   0xac    3   ULEB128 type entry offset
                                     4- or 8-byte offset of DIE
                                     ULEB128 number of arguments
