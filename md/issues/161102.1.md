Section 2.6.2, pg 44
"A counted location description operand consists of a two-byte 
unsigned integer giving the length of the location description"

That length could be for example uleb128 as 99.9~% of those expression
lengths are only few bytes long (definitely <=127) and it would save 
1 byte for each location.

Not a big improvement but when a new section has been introduced anyway.
Not important: Or it could be some other encoding as uleb128 permits even 
values >65535 while DWARF DW_OP_bra and other opcodes do not expect DWARF
expressions larger than 65535.
