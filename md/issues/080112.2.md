Background

Since expressions can contain reference to DIEs, it's important for any 
generic DWARF consumer to be able to identify and parse expressions without 
a complete understanding of what attributes may have blocks that should be 
treated as expressions. This proposal adds a new form, `DW_FORM_expr`, which 
takes a ULEB128 length parameter, followed by "length" bytes interpreted as 
an expression.

I don't believe that fixed 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-byte lengths are necessary 
here -- any producer should be able to determine how long the expression 
is before it needs to emit the length field.

This proposal also deprecates DW_FORM_block1, block2, and block4 in favor 
of `DW_FORM_block`. For blocks that aren't expressions (e.g., constant values 
expressed as a block of bytes), the length of the block can just as easily 
be expressed as a ULEB128. Any producer can reasonably be expected to know 
how long the block is before it needs to emit the length.


Proposal

The proposed changes to the DWARF specification are detailed below, keyed 
to the section numbering for the December 20, 2005, version of the DWARF-3 
document.

In Section 2.2, "Attribute Types," add the following row to the table of 
Figure 3:

 expr     An arbitrary number of bytes of data, interpreted
          as a DWARF expression (see Section 2.5).

[Note: The terminology for DWARF expressions has been under discussion. 
This proposal may need to be updated to be consistent with the final 
terminology.]

In Section 6.4.2.2, "CFA Definition Instructions," Item 6, 
"`DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression`", change "`DW_FORM_block`" to "`DW_FORM_expr`".

In Section 7.5.4, "Attribute Encodings," add the following paragraph to 
the description of class block:

 The use of forms DW_FORM_block1, DW_FORM_block2,
 and DW_FORM_block4 is deprecated. Producers should
 use `DW_FORM_block` instead.

Add the following paragraphs immediately preceding the description for 
class flag:

 expr

   Represented as an unsigned LEB128 length followed by the
   number of bytes specified by the length (`DW_FORM_expr`).
   The information bytes contain a DWARF expression (see
   Section 2.5).

In FIgure 20, "Attribute encodings," change "block" to "expr" in the 
"Classes" column for the following attributes:

 `DW_AT_location`
 `DW_AT_byte_size`
 `DW_AT_bit_offset`
 `DW_AT_bit_size`
 `DW_AT_string_length`
 `DW_AT_lower_bound`
 `DW_AT_return_addr`
 `DW_AT_upper_bound`
 `DW_AT_count`
 `DW_AT_data_member_location`
 `DW_AT_discr_list`
 `DW_AT_frame_base`
 `DW_AT_namelist_item`
 `DW_AT_segment`
 `DW_AT_static_link`
 `DW_AT_use_location`
 `DW_AT_vtable_elem_location`
 `DW_AT_allocated`
 `DW_AT_associated`
 `DW_AT_data_location`
 `DW_AT_byte_stride`

In Figure 21, add the following row:

 Form name       Value    Class

 `DW_FORM_expr`    0x18     expr

Accepted with changes:
  1.  Remove `DW_AT_namelist_item` from list of changes
  2.  Fix typo on pg. 136 -- `DW_AT_namelist_item` is reference, not block
  3.  No deprecation of block1-4
  4.  Clarify block form description (pg. 126) with reference to expr.
