Section 7.12, pg 228
Language encodings describe different languages, but c++03 (unlike c++11 
and c++14) didn't change the language. C++03 is just C++98 with some DRs. 
So for producers and consumers c++98 and c++03 look completely similar. 
It was originally requested in Issue 120628.1, but the submitter agreed 
with the consensus on the dwarf-discuss list to remove it.

12/06/2016 -- Rejected.
  Previously considered by DWARF Committee (issue 120628.1).
  Producers which wish to identify C++03 as C++98 may do so; this is QoI issue.
