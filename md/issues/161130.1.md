Section 6.3.1, pg 166
The macro information entries in the opcode_operands_table may be described 
in the table. But some cannot be described because some forms are not in the 
list of allowed forms.

In particular DW_FORM_strp_sup is missing so DW_MACRO_define_sup and 
DW_MACRO_undef_sup cannot be described. And DW_FORM_ref_sup is missing, 
making it impossible to describe DW_MACRO_import_sup. Also DW_FORM_line_strp 
isn't allowed. But it might be beneficial for describing files referenced by macros.

Add DW_FORM_strp_sup, DW_FORM_ref_sup and DW_FORM_line_strp to the list of 
allowed forms at the end of point 4 opcode_operands_table.

  Allow FORM_strp_sup, FORM_line_strp for DW_MACRO_define_sup and DW_MACRO_undef_sup.
  DW_FORM_ref_sup not needed, since references are not needed.
