Section 6.1.1.4.1, pg 143
"The presence of an unrecognised augmentation string may make it impossible for a 
consumer to process data in the .debug_names section."

I would expect the standard to be more directive - either consumer should reject 
.debug_names with unrecognized augmentation or not.

Maybe it would be best to rather have two augmentation strings:
 * one incompatible: reject whole .debug_names if unrecognized
 * one compatible: ignore such unrecognized compatible-augmentation string

Text will be changed to 
*The presence of an unrecognized augmentation string does not make it
impossible for a consumer to process data in the .debug_names section.
The augmentation string only provides hints to the consumer regarding
the completeness of the set of names in the index.*
