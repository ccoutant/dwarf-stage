Section 5.15, pg 
This is a proposal to reconsider 130318.1, which was approved in 
July (pending an examples section to be supplied). In particular, 
the proposal is to replace 130318.1 in toto with a new formulation 
as described below.

Background

130318.1 is an outgrowth of the older 121112.1, which proposed a
fairly general `DW_TAG_refine_type` entry that could be used to
add various properties to a type, notably make it into a co-array
or add the dynamic properties represented by the `DW_AT_allocated`
and `DW_AT_associated` attributes. The committee opted for a more
specific and specialized construct for co-arrays (and similarly
assumed rank arrays), leaving the dynamic type related-attributes
to be addressed.

The dynamic type attributes `DW_AT_allocated` and `DW_AT_associated`
were added to DWARF in Version 3 to address FORTRAN needs. There
is no additional semantic functionality that needs to be expressed--
the `DW_AT_data_location` attribute can be used in combination with
`DW_AT_allocated` and/or `DW_AT_associated` to effectively describe a 
variety of needs in Fortran, Ada, and other languages (see Appendix 
D.2).

The case was made, however, that Fortran's syntax for adding the
dynamic properties to an existing type can lead to excessive
replication of DWARF description if these attributes must be added
to new types that are otherwise the same as earlier.

Unfortunately the matters of type description and run-time 
type representation (a potential descriptor) became more entangled 
that seems necessary or desirable. The resulting proposal and 
justification for the `DW_TAG_descriptor_type` reflects that.

In addition, the 1130318.1 proposal contains this sweeping statement

    "Any other attributes and/or children debugging information 
    entries on the descriptor type entry would behave identically
    as if the attribute and/or children DIEs [sic] are attached
    to the referencing type entry."
    
As formulated, this doesn't work if the referenced type has a
`DW_AT_name` attribute. In the example of that proposal this results
in multiple descriptor type declarations, all with the name "dt"
(like the referenced type). And it is unclear whether a descriptor
type can have a name in its own right, although apparently not.

More generally, not addressed is the effect of a `DW_AT_allocated`
or `DW_AT_associated` attribute on the descriptor type if there is
a corresponding attribute on the referenced type.

Following is a new formulation that seeks to provide the intended
functionality in a way that directly addresses the DWARF replication
motivation without mixing in descriptor concepts.

Proposal

1) In Table 2.1: Tag names add

        `DW_TAG_dynamic_type`
        
2) Renumber the existing 5.15, "Dynamic Type Properties" to 5.15.1
making it part of the following new 5.15:

    "5.15 Dynamic Type Entries and Properties
    *Some languages such as Fortran 90, provide types whose values
    may be dynamically allocated or associated with a variable
    under explicit program control. However, unlike the related
    pointer type in C or C++, the indirection involved in accessing
    the value of the variable is generally implicit, that is, not
    indicated as part of program source.*
    
    A dynamic type entry is used to declare a dynamic type that is 
    "just like" another non-dynamic type without needing to
    replicate the full description of that other type.

    A dynamic type is represented by a debugging information entry
    with the tag `DW_TAG_dynamic_type`. If a name has been given to the
    dynamic type, then the dynamic type has a `DW_AT_name` attribute 
    whose value is a null-terminated string containing the dynamic
    type name as it appears in the source.
    
    A dynamic type entry has a `DW_AT_type` attribute whose value is a
    reference to the type of the entities that are dynamically allocated.
    
    A dynamic type entry also has a `DW_AT_data_location`, and may also
    have `DW_AT_allocated` and/or `DW_AT_associated` attributes as 
    described following (Section 5.15.1). The type referenced by the
    `DW_AT_type` attribute must not have any of these attributes.
    
3) The current 5.15, "Dynamic Type Properties", is renumbered to 5.15.1.
At the beginning of 5.15.1 insert:

    *The `DW_AT_data_location`, `DW_AT_allocated` and `DW_AT_associated` 
    attributes described in this section can be used for any type, not
    just dynamic types.*
    
4) The current 5.15.1, "Data Location" is renumbered to 5.15.1.1, and
5.15.2, "Allocation and Association Status" is renumbered to
5.15.1.2.

5) The recently introduced 5.15.3, "Array Rank" (mis-numbered as 
5.15.4 in the October 27, 2013 draft because of an earlier header 
level error) is renumbered to 5.15.1.3. 

6) Add `DW_TAG_dynamic_type` to Table 7-1 (encoding TBD).

7) Add to Table A.1: List of attributes allowed on `DW_TAG_descriptor_type`

        `DW_TAG_dynamic_type`
            DECL
            `DW_AT_abstract_origin`
            `DW_AT_allocated`
            `DW_AT_associated`
            `DW_AT_data_location`
            `DW_AT_description`
            `DW_AT_name`
            `DW_AT_type`
            `DW_AT_sibling`


8) Add the following example at the end of Appendix D.2.1, "Fortran
Array Example":
    
    Consider the Fortran 90 example of dynamic properties in Figure 
    D.<1>. This can be represented in DWARF as illustrated in Figure
    D.<2>. Note that unnamed dynamic types are used to avoid replicating
    the full description of the underlying type dt that is shared by
    several variables.
