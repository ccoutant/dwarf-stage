Currently, there is no way to specify that a typedef is artificially generated 
by the compiler. This is particularly useful when a typedef is built-in into 
the compiler, and no DECL is defined. To avoid using 0 on DECL attributes, 
`DW_AT_artificial` should be available to tell the debuggers that this typedef 
was generated.

Real-world cases where I see this applicable are compilers that generate C 
standard typedefs to speed up a compilation or typedef members inside of 
generated structs that are composed by other derivate types with an opaque 
pointer. An example of these data types is D associative array structs that 
contain an opaque pointer matching a key and value typedef.

The DWARF specification can also be revised to accommodate the `DW_AT_artificial`
attribute on other tags.
