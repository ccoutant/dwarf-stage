There is an emerging language called D.  It is largely compatible with C, 
thus it is already (sort of) capable of generating DWARF information.  
According to http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm, as of writing, it's the 30th 
most popular language.  This language is currently used on Linux, Windows, 
and OS X.  There is a gcc-derived compiler in the works, and we expect it 
will eventually become part of the gcc distribution.

More information about D is available at http://www.digitalmars.com/d

-Request
Add a Language identifier for the D language.

-Additions to DWARF3 Spec as of November 12, 2003:
Add to Figure 8 ["Language Names"; 3.1.1, pp. 46-47]:

   `DW_LANG_D`            D

Add to Figure 27 ["Language encodings"; 7.12, p. 153]:

   `DW_LANG_ObjC`            0x001d

Doesn't really matter what the number is... Unfortunately 0x000d is taken  ;) 

If possible, I would like similar additions made to the DWARF2 spec.

I'm trying to put D support into GDB, so these additions would be invaluable 
in getting D patches added to GDB's main tree.

==================================================

Accepted, correcting typo: `DW_LANG_ObjC` should be `DW_LANG_D`.
