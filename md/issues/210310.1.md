Section 3.1.3, pg 68
The statement that `DW_AT_rnglists_base` is inherited by the split full unit from 
skeleton unit creates some confusion about whether a `DW_FORM_rnglistx` in the split 
full unit can refer to ranges in `.debug_rnglists` (non-dwo) via `DW_AT_rnglists_base` 
on the skeleton CU.

The consensus seems to be that the only ranges that can be referenced from inside
a .dwo are in the rnglists.dwo and the only ones that can be referenced from the
skeleton unit are in `.debug_rnglists` (non-.dwo).

Specific changes to the DWARF spec:

3.1.3, page 68:

"The following attributes are not part of a split full compilation unit entry but 
instead are inherited (if present) from the corresponding skeleton compilation unit:
 `DW_AT_low_pc`, `DW_AT_high_pc`, `DW_AT_ranges`, `DW_AT_stmt_list`, `DW_AT_comp_dir`, 
`DW_AT_str_offsets_base`, `DW_AT_addr_base` and `DW_AT_rnglists_base`."

Should be modified to remove the mention of `DW_AT_rnglists_base`, instead reading:

  "The following attributes are not part of a split full compilation unit entry 
but instead are inherited (if present) from the corresponding skeleton compilation 
unit: `DW_AT_low_pc`, `DW_AT_high_pc`, `DW_AT_ranges`, `DW_AT_stmt_list`, `DW_AT_comp_dir`, 
`DW_AT_str_offsets_base`, and `DW_AT_addr_base`."

Table F.1, page 395

  Modify the `DW_AT_rnglists_base` row to include a checkmark in the "Skeleton" column.

(`DW_AT_rnglists_base` is already correctly listed under `DW_TAG_skeleton_unit` in 
Appendix A, attributes by tag)

Figure B.2, page 278-279

  Include a block for `.debug_rnglists`, with an edge to it from "`.debug_info` 
  (Skeleton CU)"

  this edge should have a description the same as the matching edge in Figure B.1:
    " `.debug_info` to `.debug_rnglists` 
      An attribute value of class rnglist (specifically form `DW_FORM_rnglistx` or
  `DW_FORM_sec_offset`) is an index or offset within the `.debug_rnglists` section of 
  a range list."
