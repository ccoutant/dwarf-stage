Background 

If one was to encounter a DW_OP_addr in the middle of a
DW_CFA_expression, how is one supposed to determine the size of a target
address, so they know how many bytes to read?  You could find the
debug_info compile unit that references the same code as the FDE, but
there are a lot of hoops to jump through to do this.  Also, some
compiler vendors always generate .debug_frame sections, even if no other
debugging information is generated.  Thus, they cannot rely on there
being a .debug_info compile unit header to find the address size.

The same is true for DW_CFA_set_loc.

We have always encoded all target addresses as 4-byte values for all
ISAs to avoid these issues, even if they are actually smaller.  I'm just
curious about how a completely generic DWARF reader might handle this,
without any knowledge of the target architecture.

PROPOSAL (revised 4/2/2007):

This change requires changing the version number of .debug_frame.

In the .debug_frame section, add address size and segment size fields
to CIEs.  Specifically, in section 6.4.1, add, between 'augmentation'
and 'code_alignment_factor' in the CIE text:

    5.  address_size (ubyte)

    The size of a target address in this CIE and any FDEs that use it, in
    bytes.  If a Compilation Unit exists for this frame that Compilation
    Unit address size must match the address size here.

    6.  segment_size (ubyte)

    The size of a segment selector in this CIE and any FDEs that use it,
    in bytes.

In the FDE description, add the following to the end of the
description of 'initial location':

    If the 'segment_size' field of this FDE's CIE is non-zero, the
    initial location is preceded by a segment selector of the given
    length.

In section 6.4.2.1, "Row Creation instructions", change the word
'address' in the first sentence to 'target address', to make it
clearer that the size of the field is controlled by the CIE's
address_size field.  To the end of the paragraph, add the sentence:

    If the 'segment_size' field of this FDE's CIE is non-zero, the
    address operand is preceded by a segment selector of the given
    length.
