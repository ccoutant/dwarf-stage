Section Many, pg Many

Background:

`DW_FORM_strp_sup` represents an offset within the supplementary file.
However, being a reference, the size of `strp_sup` depends on the 
DWARF-32/64 format of the section _from_ which the reference is made,
and it should instead accommodate the format of the section _to_ which
the reference is made. This is the same argument for why we have 
`DW_FORM_ref_sup`[4,8] instead of simply `DW_FORM_ref_sup`.

While compiling the set of specification changes for this issue, I
discovered a related error: A sentence in section 7.5.5 (describing the
'string' class) describing what `DW_FORM_strp_sup` means within a 
supplementary object file, when section 7.3.6 says this form is not used 
in those files.  The proposal below removes the sentence from section
7.5.5, assuming that the description in section 7.3.6 is correct.


Proposed specification changes:

Section 6.2.4.1 Standard Content Descriptions, p.158

In item 1 `DW_LNCT_path`, first paragraph, replace the sentence:

  If the form code is `DW_FORM_line_strp`, `DW_FORM_strp`, or `DW_FORM_strp_sup`,
  then the string is included in the ``.debug_line_str``, ``.debug_str`` or
  supplementary string section, respectively, and its offset occurs
  immediately in the containing `directories` or ``file_names`` field.

With this:

  If the form code is `DW_FORM_line_strp` or `DW_FORM_strp`,
  then the string is included in the ``.debug_line_str`` or ``.debug_str``
  section, respectively; if the form code is DW_FORM_strp_sup4 or
  DW_FORM_strp_sup8, then the string is included in the supplementary
  string section; and in all these cases, the offset of the string
  within its section occurs immediately in the containing `directories`
  or ``file_names`` field.


Section 6.3.1 Macro Information Header, p.167

In the list of allowed forms, on line 10, replace "`DW_FORM_strp_sup`"
with "DW_FORM_strp_sup4, DW_FORM_strp_sup8".


Section 7.3.6 DWARF Supplementary Object Files, p.195

On line 22, replace "`DW_FORM_strp_sup`" with "DW_FORM_strp_sup4 or
DW_FORM_strp_sup8".

On line 25, replace "`DW_FORM_strp_sup`" with "DW_FORM_strp_sup4
or DW_FORM_strp_sup8".

After the paragraph ending on line 27, add a non-normative paragraph:

  *Forms for both 4- and 8-byte references are provided so that references
  may use the appropriate offset size for the content of the supplementary
  object file, which might not use the same 32-bit or 64-bit DWARF format
  as a referencing object file.*


Section 7.4 32-Bit and 64-Bit DWARF Formats, p.197

In the table for item 3, remove the entry for `DW_FORM_strp_sup`.


Section 7.5.5 Classes and Forms, p.218

In the bullet item for class string, second sub-bullet (lines 20-30):

- on line 24, replace the parenthetical (`DW_FORM_strp_sup`) with
  (DW_FORM_strp_sup4, DW_FORM_strp_sup8).

- remove the next sentence, "`DW_FORM_strp_sup` offsets from ..."
  (this sentence describes a situation that is forbidden by Section 7.3.6).

- on line 28, remove "`DW_FORM_strp_sup`" and editorially adjust as needed
  (so the sentence describes only `DW_FORM_strp` and `DW_FORM_line_strp`).

- add a sentence at the end of this sub-bullet as follows:
    A supplementary string reference (DW_FORM_strp_sup4 or DW_FORM_strp_sup8)
    is a 4- or 8-byte offset (respectively) from the beginning of the
    ``.debug_str`` section in the supplementary object file.


Section 7.5.6, Form Encodings, Table 7.6

Remove (or mark as obsolete) the entry for `DW_FORM_strp_sup` (0x1d).
Add entries for DW_FORM_strp_sup4 and DW_FORM_strp_sup8, both class string.
