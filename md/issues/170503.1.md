On behalf of Kotlin team, I'm sending this request to add DW_LANG_Kotlin constant in 
DW_AT_laguage. We've released first technical preview of Kotlin Native based on llvm 
infrastructure (https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/04/kotlinnative-tech-preview-kotlin-without-a-vm/).
For the next version we've finished basic dwarf generation already, and we need this constant 
for providing  better debugger support in future releases.

Proposed encoding:  DW_LANG_Kotlin  0x0026
