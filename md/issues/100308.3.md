Section 6.2.2, pg 110:
end_sequence A boolean indicating that the current address is that of the first byte after
             the end of a sequence of target machine instructions. end_sequence
             terminates a sequence of lines; therefore other information in the same
             row are not meaningful.

"are not meaningful" should be "is not meaningful".
