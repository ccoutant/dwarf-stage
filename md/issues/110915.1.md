For OpenCL Debugging, two new new dwarf tokens are required:

`DW_AT_address_space`: In order for the debugger to correctly know which OpenCL address space to read data from.

`DW_AT_resource_id` : This will allow the debugger to know which resource ID to use when reading
memory from unordered access view (UAV) UAVs can be found on AMD GPUs which you can use for debugging OpenCL.

Issue rejected 3/19/2013 -- there is insufficient description of what these
proposed attributes would represent or how they would be used.
