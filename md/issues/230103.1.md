Section 6.4.2.4, pg 181
p181 6.4.2.4 Row State Instructions describes the required actions for 
`DW_CFA_remember_state` and `DW_CFA_restore_state`:

  `DW_CFA_remember_state`
  The `DW_CFA_remember_state` instruction takes no operands. The required 
  action is to push the set of rules for every register onto an implicit stack.
  
  `DW_CFA_restore_state`
  The `DW_CFA_restore_state` instruction takes no operands. The required action
  is to pop the set of rules off the implicit stack and place them in the current row.

The description of `DW_CFA_remember_state` should take the current CFA into 
account. Suggested change:

  `DW_CFA_remember_state`
  The `DW_CFA_remember_state` instruction takes no operands. The required 
  action is to push the set of rules for **the current CFA and** every 
  register onto an implicit stack.

The description of `DW_CFA_restore_state` can remain as is as "the set of 
rules" clearly includes the current CFA described by `DW_CFA_remember_state`.

The stack implementations of libunwind src/dwarf/Gparser.c, gcc 
libgcc/unwind-dw2.c, and llvm-project libunwind/src/DwarfParser.hpp all 
include the current CFA in the implicit stack.
