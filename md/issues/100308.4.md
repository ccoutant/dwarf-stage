Section 7.27, pg 188:
"A type or other debugging information entry should not be placed in 
a separate type unit if any of the following apply:"

The following three bullets all refer solely to types, and do so with 
three different wordings: "The type has", "The type T has", "A type has".  
Shouldn't they refer to DIEs as opposed to types, and do so with consistent 
wording?  E.g., "A debugging information entry has".

Change line to "A debugging information entry should not be placed in
a separate type unit if any of the following apply:".
