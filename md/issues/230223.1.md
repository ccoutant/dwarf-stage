Section 2.6, pg 38-39

Two editorial fixes for location descriptions.

A. exprloc contains a single location description
-------------------------------------------------

According to section 2.6, location descriptions can have one of two 
forms: single location descriptions, or location lists.  However, the
last sentence on p.38 doesn't quite get this right.

Original sentence:

>   As the value of an attribute, a location description is encoded using
>   class exprloc and a location list is encoded using class loclist
>   (which serves as an index into a separate section containing location
>   lists).

Insert "single" into the first line, to make this read correctly:

>   ... a single location description is encoded using class exprloc ...


B. The description is not the object
------------------------------------

Section 2.6.1.1 says:

>   A simple location description consists of one contiguous piece or all
>   of an object or value.

Replace "consists of" with "represents" (the usual word we use in this
section) or possibly "describes" (which we probably mostly avoid because
of the unfortunate sound of "description describes").
