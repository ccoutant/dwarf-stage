Section 3, pg 77,89
On page 89 in section 3.4.1 line 21-22 it says: “Call site entries cannot describe 
tail recursion or optimized out calls.” but section 3.3.1.3 page 77 lines 30-32 
says: “any call that is optimized out is nonetheless also described using a 
`DW_TAG_call_site` entry that has neither a `DW_AT_call_pc` no `DW_AT_call_return_pc` 
attribute.” These appear to conflict with each other and do not reflect the 
current practice of compilers.

On page 77:
it should say probably say "any call that is optimized out is nonetheless also 
described using a `DW_TAG_call_site` entries with `DW_AT_call_return_pc` attribute"

On page 89 
"Call site entries cannot describe tail recursion or optimized out calls." 
should be replaced with "Call site entries without `DW_AT_call_return_pc` attribute 
may describe tail recursion or optimized out calls."

This issue was originally reported by James Kupsch <kupsch@cs.wisc.edu> and 
Jakub Jelinek requested that I file this comment.

   “can’t describe” -> “can’t fully describe”, add non-normative text to explain.
   No changes to text on pg. 77.
