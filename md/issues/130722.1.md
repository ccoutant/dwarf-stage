Section Appendix A, pg 200, 210

In Appendix A, for DW_TAG_member and DW_TAG_variable, please add DW_AT_artificial.
Currently DW_AT_artificial is listed only for subprogram and formal_parameter;
we're seeing them for member (class virtual-table pointer) and variable (implicit
loop control variables for range loops) as well.
