Section 6.1.1.4.7, pg 146

6.1.1.4.7 Abbreviations Table (elsewhere called Entry Pool)
says on lines 24 through 28

"Following the tag encoding is a series of attribute specifications. Each attribute 
consists of two parts:
an unsigned LEB128 number that represents the index attribute, and another unsigned
LEB128 number that represents the attributeâ€™s form (as described in Section 7.5.4 on
page 207).

Section 7.5.4 on page 207 describes the attribute NAME, not attribute FORM.

That section's title is "Abbreviations Table" but it would remove some potential 
ambiguity to name it "Abbreviations Table/Entry Pool" so it relates more clearly 
the wonderful diagrams.
