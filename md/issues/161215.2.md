Section 6.2.4, pg 153
Given that DWARF-5 already expects one may for example keep .debug_line and strip
.debug_info then DW_AT_producer should be present even in .debug_line's header.

DW_AT_producer is useful to selectively apply various producer-bugs workarounds.

Rejected 1/3/2017.
Consumers should used features described in DWARF and not depend on the producer ID.
