Section 3.9, pg 94

page 94 line 26 ends with

"base address entry, a default location entry or an end-of-list entry."

The phrase ", a default location entry" should be deleted.

According to our esteemed editor that is an accident, 
copy-paste error from the very similar loclists section wording.
It does not apply to rnglists.

RESOLUTION

The Editor concurs with his esteemed opinion of many moons ago. 

Delete the errant phrase as recommended.
