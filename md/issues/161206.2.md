Section 2.6.1.2, pg 42
The current specifications of `DW_OP_piece` and `DW_OP_bit_piece` do not
make it sufficiently clear whether `DW_OP_piece` is just a
backward-compatible short-hand notation for special cases of
`DW_OP_bit_piece`.  All DWARF producers/consumers I know of interpret it
that way, but the current specification says otherwise:

- `DW_OP_piece`: "If the piece is located in a register, but does not
  occupy the entire register, the placement of the piece within that
  register is defined by the ABI."
- `DW_OP_bit_piece`: "If the location is a register, the offset is from
  the least significant bit end of the register."

This wording seems to imply that byte- and bit pieces may follow
different rules for the placement of pieces within a register, one
defined by the ABI, and the other being the LSB0 rule defined by
DWARF.

Also, placement rules for other types of objects are only given for
`DW_OP_bit_piece` and missing for `DW_OP_piece`.

Thus I propose to clarify the specification of `DW_OP_piece` in 2.6.1.2
"Composite Location Descriptions":

      1. `DW_OP_piece`

      The `DW_OP_piece` operation takes a single operand, which is
      an unsigned LEB128 number.  The number gives the size in
      bytes of the piece of the object referenced by the
      preceding simple location description.  The placement of
      the piece within that object is the same as defined by the
      appropriate `DW_OP_bit_piece` operation with offset zero.
      Thus the following operations are equivalent:
      - `DW_OP_piece` <n>
      - `DW_OP_bit_piece` <8*n> 0


RESOLUTION

We found that multiple big-endian ABIs (including MIPS, and Sparc) are
defining `DW_OP_piece` as different from `DW_OP_Bit_piece` with offset 0.
In order to avoid breaking compatibility, we add the following 
non-normative text to Section 2.6.1.2:

   *For instance, so that structure variables passed by register can be
   loaded and stored using register-sized transfers, a big-endian ABI may
   specify that the pieces of a structure are "left aligned" within a
   register (located in the most significant bytes of the register). Thus,
   `DW_OP_piece` <n> is not necessarily equivalent to `DW_OP_bit_piece` <8*n> 0.*

  *Whether or not a `DW_OP_piece` operation is equivalent to any `DW_OP_bit_piece`
  operation with an offset of 0 is ABI dependent.*
