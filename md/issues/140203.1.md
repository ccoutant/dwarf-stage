Section 7.31, pg 192

With the addition of DW_FORM_exprloc with DWARF4 it appears to have gotten left 
out of the type unit hashing.

This would make the line at the end of paragraph 4 read:

"... limited to the following: DW_FORM_sdata, DW_FORM_flag, DW_FORM_string, 
DW_FORM_exprloc, and DW_FORM_block."

Unless exprloc is considered similar enough to flag and string in that flag_present
and strp are hashed to flag and string respectively and exprloc should be hashed 
the same as block.
