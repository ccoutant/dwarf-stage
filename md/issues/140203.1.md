Section 7.31, pg 192

With the addition of `DW_FORM_exprloc` with DWARF4 it appears to have gotten left 
out of the type unit hashing.

This would make the line at the end of paragraph 4 read:

"... limited to the following: `DW_FORM_sdata`, `DW_FORM_flag`, `DW_FORM_string`, 
`DW_FORM_exprloc`, and `DW_FORM_block`."

Unless exprloc is considered similar enough to flag and string in that `flag_present`
and strp are hashed to flag and string respectively and exprloc should be hashed 
the same as block.
