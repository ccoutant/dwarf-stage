Section 6.2.4.1, pg 158
The current draft specifies just DW_FORM_string, DW_FORM_line_strp
and DW_FORM_strx as valid forms for DW_LNCT_path.  Is that really what we
want to limit to?

Or shall the options also include DW_FORM_strp and DW_FORM_strp_sup?

I mean, I haven't seen anybody trying to strip .debug* sections other than
.debug_line, people either strip all debugging sections, or none, so not
sure it is worth emitting .debug_line_str by default, instead of just adding
the strings into .debug_str, and in that case DW_FORM_strp for DW_LNCT_path
would be useful.

And, for the supplemental debug info files, we don't have
DW_FORM_line_strp_dup, but filenames and directory names will certainly be
something that will be heavily shareable between different executables
and/or shared libraries of the same package, so putting them into
supplemental debug info file's .debug_str section and refering to them
through DW_FORM_strp_sup should be very useful.

  Allow DW_FORM_strp and DW_FORM_strp_sup for DW_LNCT_path.
