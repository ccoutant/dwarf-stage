DWARF5 Section 7.5.3, pg 207
BACKGROUND

`DW_FORM_indirect` and `DW_FORM_implicit_const`
are not described fully and this can lead to
the forms being unreasonable or unimplementable.

A simple clarification/generalization
resolves all the issues while keeping compatibility
with DWARF5 wording.

From the index:
`DW_FORM_implicit_const`, pages 9,209,214,221
`DW_FORM_indirect`, pages 207,220,288.

the descriptions are in section 7.5.3 page 207:

====DWARF 5 page 207 starting at line 6:
The attribute form `DW_FORM_indirect` is a special case. For
attributes with this form, the attribute value itself in
the `.debug_info` section begins with an unsigned LEB128
number that represents its form. This allows producers to
choose forms for particular attributes dynamically, without
having to add a new entry to the abbreviations table.

The attribute form `DW_FORM_implicit_const` is another
special case. For attributes with this form, the attribute
specification contains a third part, which is a signed
LEB128 number. The value of this number is used as the
value of the attribute, and no value is stored in the
`.debug_info` section.
===end quote of standard.

Add to the first paragraph:

A sequence of form `DW_FORM_indirect` in `.debug_info`
is allowed.


Revise the second paragraph to read:

The attribute form `DW_FORM_implicit_const` is another
special case. For attributes with this form, the attribute
specification contains a third part which
follows the `DW_FORM_implicit_const` unsigned
LEB128 and is a signed
LEB128 number. The value of this number is used as the
value of the attribute.
