A colleague has observed that there is a problem in how to intrepret an
`DW_AT_start_scope` attribute when the containing scope is discontiguous.
Because there is no required ordering for the segments of a discontiguous
scope (in the `.debug_loc` section), there is no defined sequence of
segments in which to interpret the `start_address` attribute.

Following is his problem description together with one suggestion for how
to resolve it.

Consider a scope

            {

                        part1

                        part 2 int a = f();

                        part3

                        part4

            }

which, for optimization reasons, has been emitted as instructions in the
following address order

            part3

            ...

            part2 int a = f();

            ...

            part4

            ...

            part1


The Scope should have `DW_AT_ranges` as its pc encoding.

But what should "a" have as its `DW_AT_start_scope`?


I suggest that the committee consider requiring...

(1) The `DW_AT_ranges` be output in LEXICAL ASCENDING order

(2) The `DW_AT_start_scope` be the offset from the first range (possibly
    negative) or (alternative proposal) from the lowest `low_pc`

This would enable the debugger to determine that A is visible in the later
half of part2, all of part3 and part4, but not in part1

It's a shame that the 'rangelistptr' and 'constant' classes overlap
(both use `DW_FORM_data`{4,8}).  Otherwise, we could simply allow
`DW_AT_start_scope` to be a range list, instead of a simple offset.

I'd suggest:
- saying that `DW_AT_start_scope` cannot be used when the enclosing
  scope's location is a rangelist, and
- providing an alternative attribute, `DW_AT_scope_ranges`, whose value
  is a rangelist indicating where the object is in scope.  Producers
  can use this when `DW_AT_start_scope` cannot be used.

Apparently fixing `DW_AT_start_scope` requires constraining 
either range lists or `DW_AT_start_scope`. 
Jim Blandy suggests constraining range lists. 

I suggest constraining `DW_AT_start_scope`.

With my proposal, the optimization causes a loss in precision of
the start-of-range (in this formulation) when the range is
actually split up.

PROPOSAL:

In 2.16.3,  add after a new paragraph after the second paragraph,
with contents:

"If a `DW_AT_start_scope` attribute refers to code described by a
range list  with more than as single entry the starting-point
of the scope becomes ambiguous (as it is impossible to tell
from the range list what areas logically preceed or follow the
instruction address in the areas described)  so any
`DW_AT_start_scope` should be ignored (as if `DW_AT_start_scope`
were not present)."

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Modified:  
`DW_AT_start_scope` is offset from FIRST location in a discontiguous scope.
