DWARF5 Section 6.1.1.2, page 140
When implementing a reader of the DWARF5 name table I found the
bottom part (Entry Pool part) of page 140 to be less than helpful.

Page 140 leaves out mention of the Abbrev Table entirely,
and says attributes are in the Entry Pool, which is incorrect
as the Entry Pool has abbrev codes and *values for attributes*,
not attributes themselves (Is there a terminology in the document
to distinguish these two ideas?).

What follows incorporates significant suggestions by Ron Brender
on how things could look.

Given the difficulty of communicating a graphic with
text wording
Ron B prepared a pdf of the proposed look
after he and I refined
and clarified the plain-text
version of the proposal.

Here is a three page pdf of Figure 6.1, the whole figure.
The  change here is the bottom box of page 142 in the pdf
and the top boxes on page 143.
