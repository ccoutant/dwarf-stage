Section Many, pg Many
Background:
Some consumers (notably LLDB) can load debugging information faster if
the DIEs are (mostly) fixed-size.  It's possible to determine whether
a given DIE is fixed-size just by looking at the list of FORMs used by
its attributes, which are readily available in the abbreviations;
pre-parsing the abbreviations makes this a very simple task.

Key producers (at least gcc and clang) currently emit most or all
strings into the `.debug_str` section and use `DW_FORM_strp` to specify a
reference to the string.  In DWARF 5 we have introduced `DW_FORM_strx`;
we should expect producers to take advantage of this new form.

`DW_FORM_strp` is a fixed-size reference; `DW_FORM_strx` is a variable-size
ULEB.  Given that a whole lot of DIEs have a `DW_AT_name` or other string, 
this turns out to cause a whole lot of DIEs to go from being fixed-size 
in DWARF 4 to variable-size in DWARF 5.  This will likely have an 
adverse effect on loading time by LLDB and other consumers.

I've tried to quantify "a whole lot" by looking at two largish programs:
Clang (as built by GCC) and a PS4 game title (as built by Clang).  It's
straightforward to count the proportion of DIEs that are fixed-size in
DWARF 4.  If we then assume all `DW_FORM_strp` become `DW_FORM_strx` in
DWARF 5, we can estimate the proportion of fixed-size DIEs in DWARF 5.

                           DWARF 4   DWARF 5
Fixed-size DIEs in Clang:   93%        57%       
Fixed-size DIEs in game7:   89%        55%

This is a very serious consequence, so I'm proposing that we add a
fixed-size variant of `DW_FORM_strx`.

The next question is, how big should this be?  How many strings per CU 
do we see from these applications?

- Clang has 1659 CUs, with a maximum of 95652 unique strings used in
any one CU.  However, 97% of CUs use no more than 65535 strings.
54% use between 2^14 and 2^16 strings (so a fixed 2-byte index would
save space compared to a 3-byte ULEB).
- Game7 has 2461 CUs, with a maximum of 17093 unique strings used in
any one CU.  Therefore, 100% of CUs use no more than 65535 strings.

This data suggests a 2-byte fixed-size variant of `DW_FORM_strx` would
suffice for nearly all string references in these two applications.

Alternatively, we could redefine `DW_FORM_strx` as a fixed-size 4-byte
index. While this achieves the goal of making the form fixed-size, and
also makes it essentially impossible to overflow, it has a significant
size cost.  Looking again at my two applications, using a 2-byte form
(with escape to ULEB when needed) saves approximately 12% compared to
using a 4-byte form.


Textual changes:

This is the 'substantive' bit.

Section 7.5.5 p.217 (class string) 3rd sub-bullet
    Rewrite the bullet as follows:
    - as an indirect offset into the string table using an index into
      a table of offsets contained in the `.debug_str_offsets` section
      of the object file. Each index is interpreted as a zero-based
      index into this table.  There are two forms for this index, a
      fixed length two byte index (DW_FORM_strx2) and a variable length
      unsigned LEB128 index (`DW_FORM_strx`). The offset entries in the
      `.debug_str_offsets` section have the same representation as
      `DW_FORM_strp` values.

The rest of the changes are just mechanically adding DW_FORM_strx2 to
all the places that currently mention `DW_FORM_strx`.
