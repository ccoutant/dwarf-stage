Revising a proposal from 2001 that we add all the items necessary for support of UPC.

   At the time (2001), this was rejected on the grounds that
   1) The standard was about to come out and it was much too late to add
      things. 
   2) There was no current practice to support it.

   Since then the standard hasn't come out :-(, and we now have current
   practice; these extensions (with an additional _UPC_ in tag names
   since they're extensions) are used by Intrepid's GCC-UPC compiler.

Here's the original message from 2001.

> 
> 1) The "shared" type qualifier.
>    This is syntactically a type-qualifier (similar to const, volatile
>    or restrict), it differs only in that it also carries a positive
>    integer value with it which defines the shared block size. This is
>    a compile time constant which describes the way in which the shared
>    object is to be distributed over the UPC threads in the executing program.
> 
> 2) The expansible array decalaration.
>    UPC allows one dimension of a shared array to be dimensioned with a
>    bound which is a multiple of the number of UPC threads instanced at
>    run time.
> 
> Neither of these concepts maps into any existing DWARF attributes or
> tags, yet both could easily be represented using one new tag and one
> new attribute. With these two additions UPC would (I believe) be fully
> covered by DWARF.
> 
> The reason for asking that these be included in the DWARF standard
> (rather than as vendor extensions) is that there are already three or
> four compiler groups working on UPC compilers. It is likely that more
> than one of them will want to use DWARF debug format.  If the concepts
> are _not_ standardised, then debuggers will have to handle different
> ways of expressing the same information in DWARF. This is unnecessary

>           int shared *p;
