Background
==========

Swift is a new programming language for iOS and OS X apps that builds
on the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C
compatibility. Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern
features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more
fun. Swift's clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa
and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how
software development works.
