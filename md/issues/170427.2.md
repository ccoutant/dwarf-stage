The original proposal sought to add some new kinds of location
list entries (LLEs). To deal with upward compatibility issues it
proposed:

>   In Section 2.6.2, page 44, add to 1. DW_LLE_end_of_list:
> 
>     Any non-standard entry kind may be interpreted as a
>     DW_LLE_end_of_list entry.

This approach has numerous issues:

  * It is not consistent with the vendor-defined extensions model
    used elsewhere in DWARF.
  * It will interfere with potential DWARF extensions because user
    extension kind codes are not segregated.
  * It actually doesn't work--from a consumer perspective, any
    unknown code is a show stopper, whether "authorized" or not.

There is no reasonable way to skip over the unknown entry and
resume following.

This replacement proposal defines a vendor-specific extension range
for LLEs. Further, because range lists and locations lists are
strongly similar in structure and organization, a similar extension
range is defined for them as well.

Text Changes
------------

1) In Section 7.1, p 183, lines 13-14, add "DW_LLE" and "DW_RLE"
in  the (alphabetical) list of prefixes that have vendor-defined
extension ranges.

2) In Section 7.7.3, p226, Table 7.10, add

    DW_LLE_lo_user    0xc0
    DW_LLE_hi_user    0xff


3) In Section 7.25, p240, Table 7.30, add

    DW_RLE_lo_user    0xc0
    DW_RLE_hi_user    0xff

A limitation of the above is that it does not address
how to assure that a vendor extension can be skipped if not known to a
consumer. The simplest strategy appears to be
to require that the beginning of an extended function be a ULEB length
of any operands (whether zero or more) that follow. The following
text changes (in addition to the changes above) express this:

4) In Section 7.7.3, following Table 7.10, insert the following:

> "If a vendor defines a vendor-specific kind of location list
> entry, the kind code must be immediately followed by an
> unsigned LEB128 value that specifies the length of all
> remaining bytes (not including either the kind or the length
> itself) for that entry."

5) In Section 7.25, following Table 7.30, insert the following:

> "If a vendor defines a vendor-specific kind of range list
> entry, the kind code must be immediately followed by an
> unsigned LEB128 value that specifies the length of all
> remaining bytes (not including either the kind or the length
> itself) for that entry."


NOTE: By editorial convention, all four entries will be marked with
double-dagger symbols indicating they are "New in DWARF Version 5".
