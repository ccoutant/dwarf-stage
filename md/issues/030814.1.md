|Unfortunately there is a awkward vocabulary problem here. At the time we
|introduced `DW_TAG_partial_unit` we debated whether the term "compilation
|unit" should include partial units or not. In favor of being inclusive
|is the fact that something like 90% of the statements throughout that DWARF
|spec that refer to "compilation units" are true of both `DW_TAG_compile_unit`
|and `DW_TAG_partial_unit`. If compilation unit was not inclusive, then
|we would need to add "and partial units" in lots of places. So we went
|with the inclusive concept. In retrospect that may have been the wrong
|decision. We should probably revisit that choice at the next opportunity.
|(Note: this is not a substantive issue, "merely" one of presentation.)

|The complaint about the undefined phrase and the suggested definition
|are both right on. Perhaps we can work that definition into the document...
