Microsoft's .NET recently added the ability to generate natively compiled 
executables with DWARF debugging information 
(<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/>).

Currently there is no language code for C#, but now that there is a 
mainstream compiler which supports generating native executables having 
a DWARF id would be useful.
