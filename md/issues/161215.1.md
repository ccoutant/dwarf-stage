Section 6.1.1.4.1, pg 143
All other debug sections are assumed to be produced by the same compiler so one can 
read `DW_AT_producer` from `.debug_info`.

`DW_AT_producer` is useful to selectively apply various producer-bugs workarounds (such
as GDB->dwarf2_frame_find_quirks->`producer_is_realview` - for `.debug_frame` and not for
`.debug_info`).

The difference for `.debug_names` is that it is typically produced by some other tool 
than the CU(s) compiler.

`.debug_names` header contains augmentation string but its contents depends on the vendor.
If the vendor does not supply its `.debug_names` producer version into that string then 
there is no way to later identify presence of producer bugs in existing binaries in wild.

Rejected 1/3/2017.
Consumers should used features described in DWARF and not depend on the producer ID.
