Section 7.12 Source Language, pg 172

As the main Haskell compiler, GHC, has started to emit DWARF output, we'd like 
to add a source language ID for Haskell, for the benefit of downstream tools 
like GDB. While there are two versions of Haskell, Haskell98 and Haskell2010, 
this distinction has no implications for what DWARF output we'd generate, so I 
suggest we just add DW_LANG_Haskell i.e. no version number, as opposed to e.g. C.
