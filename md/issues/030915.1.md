In draft8 sec 6.2.4, the unit_length field is missing the
description of 0xffffffff as the code for '64 bit length follows'.

The words used in 7.19  or 7.20 for unit_length are what I mean.

Actually might be better to move some/all of the header
description to chapter 7 (as well as fix unit_length)?



PROPOSAL:

In section 6.2.4, the initial length description, add
a new sentence to 

1. unit_length (initial length)

"The initial length field is implemented as either 32 or
64 bits as described in section 7.4."

=======================================================

Revised proposal:

Add "(see Section 7.2.2)" at the end of the sentence that describes 
the initial length fields in each of Sections 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.2.4, 
and 6.4.1.
