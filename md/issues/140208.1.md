Discussion
----------

Cary's original size optimization proposals (130331.*) specified 
the following classes of values for certain new attributes as:

    DW_AT_str_offsets_base  string
    DW_AT_addr_base         address
    DW_AT_ranges_base       rangelistptr

Your editor (masquerading as Ron) "corrected" these to all be class
reference.

When Cary saw this, he wrote:

The editor replied:

Cary and I now support Keith's suggestion. Following is the formal proposal to
incorporate it into the DWARF document.

Proposal
--------

In Table 2.3, add:

addrptr         Refers to a base location in the DWARF section that holds
                a series of machine address values. Certain attributes refer
                one of these addresses by indexing relative to this base
                location.
                
stroffsetsptr   Refers to a base location in the DWARF section that holds
                a series of offsets in the DWARF section that holds strings.
                Certain attributes refer one of these offets by indexing 
                relative to this base location. The resulting offset is the 
                used to index into the DWARF string section.

In Section 7.5.4, add:

  . addrptr
    This is an offset into the .debug_addr section (DW_FORM_sec_offset). It
    consists of an offset from the beginning of the .debug_addr section to the
    beginning of the list of machine addresses information for the
    referencing entity. It is relocatable in a relocatable object file, and relocated
    in an executable or shared object. In the 32-bit DWARF format, this offset is
    a 4-byte unsigned value; in the 64-bit DWARF format, it is an 8-byte
    unsigned value (see Section 7.4 on page 150).

  . stroffsetsptr
    This is an offset into the .debug_str_offsets section (DW_FORM_sec_offset). It
    consists of an offset from the beginning of the .debug_str_offsets section to the
    beginning of the string offsets information for the
    referencing entity. It is relocatable in a relocatable object file, and relocated
    in an executable or shared object. In the 32-bit DWARF format, this offset is
    a 4-byte unsigned value; in the 64-bit DWARF format, it is an 8-byte
    unsigned value (see Section 7.4 on page 150).
    
In Table 7.3, change the class (set of allowed representations) for these attributes:

    DW_AT_str_offsets_base  stroffsetsptr
    DW_AT_addr_base         addrptr
    DW_AT_ranges_base       rangelistptr
