Section 6.4.2.2, pg 133
The item heading "5. DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset_sf" is followed by a "6. " heading before the paragraph 
that goes with item 5.  What should be the rest of the item 6 heading, "DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression" 
in bold, immediately follows the end of the item 5 paragraph (with no space or line break).
