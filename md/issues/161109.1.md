Section 5.11, pg 126
When the producer implements Fortran derived type components with deferred length, e.g.
  type t
    integer :: j
    character(len=:), allocatable :: f
    integer :: i
  end type
like in C:
  struct t
  {
    int j;
    void *f;
    int i;
    int _f_length; // The string length *f points to.
  };
the current DWARF doesn't really allow to express this, at least not in the type
DIEs and their children (basically, for each variable of such type one would have
to create a new distinct set of type DIEs where the `DW_AT_string_length` attribute 
would use a particular location expression specific to the particular variable.

The problem is that the string length is not stored in the CHARACTER(len=:) 
objects themselves, but is shared by all the elements of the array.  The 
`DW_AT_string_length` must appear on the `DW_TAG_string_type` DIE, so 
`DW_OP_push_object_address` on it pushes the address of a particular array 
element.  Where one can evaluate the string length is the `DW_TAG_array_type`, 
where one could `DW_OP_push_object_address`, and is used for `DW_AT_data_location` 
etc.  We could e.g. allow `DW_AT_string_length` on `DW_AT_array_type` and have some
form of `DW_AT_string_length` or some new attribute on `DW_TAG_string_type` say that 
`DW_AT_string_length` location isn't provided here, but on the parent (or grand 
parent etc.) `DW_TAG_array_type`.  Or have some `DW_OP_`* that would push address 
of the containing array object instead of the current object's address.
