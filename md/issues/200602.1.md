Section 6.3.1, 6.3.3.1, pg 166, 169

The `DW_MACRO_start_file` entry states that if it is present, the macro
information header contains a reference to the `.debug_line` section of the 
compilation.

If the `DW_MACRO_start_file` entry is in a `.debug_macro`.dwo section, that
reference should probably be to the `.debug_line`.dwo section.  This will
affect the description of the "`debug_line_offset`" field in section 6.3.1,
the description of `DW_MACRO_start_file` in section 6.3.3.1, the overall
description of split units in section 7.3.2.2, and also the diagram of
section relationship in Figure B.2 and associated notes.

Possible text revisions:

Section 6.3.1, item 3:

An offset in the `.debug_line` section (if this header is in a `.debug_macro`
section) or `.debug_line`.dwo section (if this header is in a `.debug_macro`.dwo
section) of the beginning...

Section 6.3.3.1, item 1, last paragraph:

If a `DW_MACRO_start_file` entry is present, the header contains a reference
to the `.debug_line` section or `.debug_line`.dwo section of the compilation,
as appropriate.

Section 7.3.2.2, p.188 6th bullet
line 28: ... (for the type units, and macro information), ...
line 31: (add to end) and `DW_MACRO_start_file` entries in the macro information.
