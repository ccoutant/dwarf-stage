This is a proposal to unify compilation unit and type unit headers
and then take advantage of the new potential created.

This is an action item from the December 17, 2015 review meeting.
It is also draws on ideas set forth in my email of June 24, 2015,
"Unit Types Spectrum of Proposals" and July 1, 2015, "Unit Types 
Proposal".

This proposal is a superset of Issue 150702.1 which need not be 
considered if this one is accepted.

The proposal has three parts:
  1) Adopt the current type unit header layout as "the" header
     layout for all compilation types. Unused space in some
     unit types is defined as padding (and must be zeros).
  2) Define additional unit type codes (DE_UT_*) so that the
     nature or role of every kind of unit can be quickly and 
     easily identified without having to look deeper into and
     decode the following unit DIE.
  3) Add a new dwo_id field in skeleton and split compilation 
     unit headers that replaces (and eliminates the need for) 
     the DW_AT_dwo_id attribute. Use the otherwise unused space 
     that matches the type_signature field in current type units.


Discussion

Part 1
------
Currently we have two unit header layouts. Both have the
following five fields:

unit_length     4 or 12 bytes
version         uhalf
unit_type       ubyte
address_size    ubyte
debug_abbrev    4 or 8

For DW_TAG_compile_unit and DW_TAG_partial_unit that is
the complete header.

* NOTE: The October 19, 2015 document shows the address_size
* field following the debug_abbrev field. At the December 17
* meeting we agreed to reverse this order. This proposal
* assumes that change.

For DW_TAG_type_unit, two additional fields are appended
to the above:

type_signature  8 bytes
type_offset     4 or 8 bytes

This proposal adds 12 or 16 bytes of padding to the first
header layout to make it the same size as the type header.

Part 2
------
Add new codes for skeleton unit, split compilation unit, 
and split type unit. Proposed names are:
-

[ DW_UT_compile, DW_UT_partial & DW_UT_type as now +]
  DW_UT_skeleton
  DW_UT_split_compile
  DW_UT_split_type

* Variation 2a: So far we have not specified partial units
* as potential split units. I am inclined to keep it that
* way. But if we did allow split partial units, it would 
* be trivial to add one more code:
*
*     DW_UT_split_partial

This expanded set of codes makes it possible to determine
the nature of any unit without having to look into the
following unit DIE, which means accessing the associated
abbreviation table, followed by scanning/searching for the 
attributes that distinguish unit kinds. This is so much 
cleaner and simpler!

Part 3
------
A skeleton unit header currently is followed by a skeleton 
unit that includes a DW_AT_dwo_id field which is used to match
the DW_AT_dwo_id attribute in the corresponding split full 
compilation unit. This proposal eliminates the DW_AT_dwo_id
attribute. Instead, add an 8-byte unit-id file in the headers
for DW_UT_skeleton and DW_UT_split_compile. Allocate this
field in the same place as the type_signature field in
(both split and non-split) type unit headers. (There remains
either 4 or 8 bytes of padding in these two headers.)
     


DETAILED TEXTUAL PROPOSAL
-------------------------

All citations (S=>section, P=>page, L=>line, T=>table, F=>figure) 
are to the October 19, 2015 draft.

S2.2, T2.2, P17: Delete line for DW_AT_dwo_id

S3.1.2, L180--181: Replace "and DW_AT_dwo-id attributes" with
"attribute".

S3.1.2, L186: Revise to read

    A skeleton compilation unit has a DW_AT_dwo_name attribute:
    
S3.1.2, L192-200: Delete and replace with this continuation of
bullet 1:

        The value in the dwo_id field of the unit header for 
        this unit is the same as the value in the dwo_id field 
        of the unit header of the corresponding full compilation 
        unit (see Section 7.5.1 on page xxx).
        
        *The means of determining a compilation unit ID does 
        not need to be similar or related to the means of 
        determining a type unit signature. However, it should 
        be suitable for detecting file version skew or other 
        kinds of mismatched files and for looking up a full
        split unit in a DWARF package file (see Section 7.3.5
        on page xxx).*

S3.1.2, L221-223: Delete ", except for DW_AT_dwo_id...object file".
        
S3.1.3, L233-243: Replace with

    A split full compilation unit may have the following 
    attributes:

S7.3.2.2, L161-163: Delete sub-bullet ("The full compilation...")

S7.3.5, P184, L229: Delete "(DW_AT_dwo_id)".

S7.5.1, T7.2: Add the following codes:

          DW_UT_skeleton       | 0x04
          DW_UT_split_compile  | 0x05
          DW_UT_split_type     | 0x06

s7.5.1, following T7.2: Insert

    *All unit headers in a compilation have the same size.
    Some header types include padding bytes to achieve this.*
    
S7.5.1.1, following L500: Insert

    6.  *padding1* (8-byte unsigned integer)
        Reserved to DWARF (must be zero).
        
    7.  *padding2* (section offset)
        Reserved to DWARF (must be zero). In the 32-bit 
        DWARF format, this is a 4-byte unsigned length; 
        in the 64-bit DWARF format, this is an 8-byte 
        unsigned length (see Section 7.4 on page 192).

S7.5.1.2, L501: Renumber the existing 7.5.1.2 to 7.5.1.3 
and insert this new Section 7.5.1.2:

    7.5.1.2 Skeleton and Full Compilation Unit Header
    
    [[Replicate lines 475-500 describing unit_length, 
    version, unit_type, address_size and debug_abbrev_offset. 
    Then continue with:]]
    
    6.  dwo_id (8-byte unsigned integer)
        An implementation-defined integer constant value, 
        known as the compilation unit ID, that provides 
        unique identification of a skeleton compilation 
        unit and its associated split compilation unit in 
        the object file named in the DW_AT_dwo_name attribute
        of the skeleton compilation. 
    
    7.  *padding2* (section offset)
        Reserved to DWARF (must be zero). In the 32-bit 
        DWARF format, this is a 4-byte unsigned length; 
        in the 64-bit DWARF format, this is an 8-byte 
        unsigned length (see Section 7.4 on page 192).

S7.5.4, T7.5, P202: Delete line for DW_AT_dwo_id.

Appendix A, P243 (compilation unit): Delete line for 
DW_AT_dwo_id.

Appendix A, P243 (partial unit): Delete line for DW_AT_dwo_id.

Appendix B, P265 (a), L100-101: Replace  "DW_AT_dwo_id and
DW_AT_dwo_name attributes" with "DW_AT_dwo_name attribute";
replace "connect" with "connects".

Appendix B, P265 (did), L120-124: Replace with "DW_AT_dwo_name 
gives the file name which identifies the file with the .dwo 
data."

Appendix F.1, L95+: Delete DW_AT_dwo_id.

Appendix F.1, P380, L102-103: Replace "The DW_AT_dwo_id 
attribute...a match" with "The dwo_id field is present
in the header of the skeleton unit and the header of the 
full compilation unit so that a consumer can verify a match".

Appendix F.1, TF.1: Delete line for DW_AT_dwo_id

Appendix F.2, TF.4: Delete line containing DW_AT_dwo_id.

Appendix F.2, P385, L153-154: Replace 
    "The DW_AT_dwo_id attribute provides a hash of the debug 
    information 154 contained in the split DWARF object file. 
    This hash serves two purposes:" 
with 
    "The dwo_id file in the header of the skeleton unit provides 
    an ID or key for the debug information contained in the 
    DWARF object file. This ID serves two purposes:"
    
Appendix F.2.2, P388, FF.5: Delete line containing DW_AT_dwo_id.

Index: Verify DW_AT_dwo_id is no longer present...
