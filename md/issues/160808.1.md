Background
==========

The BLISS language was first created by Bill Wulf of CMU for 
the PDP-10 (BLISS-10) circa 1970. DEC adopted BLiSS as its 
implementation language for the VAX in the early 1970's (BLISS-32). 
DEC/Compac/HP developed and extended support for BLISS to the Alpha 
and Itanium architectures (MIPs too even.) BLISS is now very much 
alive and in use at VSI (VMS Systems, Inc., a recent spinoff from HP), 
which is continuing to support and enhance the VMS operating system 
on multiple architectures.
