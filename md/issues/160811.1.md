Section 5.11, pg 117

While for most of the type attributes with integral value (see 2.19 section 
Static and Dynamic Value of Attributes) the attribute can be constant class, 
exprloc or reference (the last one reference to another DIE that provides 
the integral value in its `DW_AT_location`), `DW_AT_string_length` only allows
exprloc or loclistptr.

constant class isn't needed for it, because constant string length is 
expressed by `DW_AT_byte_size`, but it would be nice to just point to a DIE of
the var holding the string length, without having to worry to propagate its
location back to the `DW_AT_string_length` attribute (and especially hard if 
the types are emitted earlier by separate compilation step).  Using DW_OP_call4 
in the `DW_AT_string_length` works for this purpose only if the variable is 
going to have DWARF expression in its `DW_AT_location`, but not if it is a 
location description (`DW_OP_stack_value` ending, `DW_OP_reg`*, etc.).
