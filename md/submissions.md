# DWARF Standards Committee Submission Standards

The DWARF Standards Committee welcomes contributions to its
mailing lists, web site, and wiki.  These contributions may
discuss the various versions of the DWARF Standard;
implementations of the DWARF Standard in compilers,
debuggers, and other tools; suggested improvements or
extensions to the DWARF Standard; or other topics related to
compilation or debugging.

All proposed changes or enhancements to the DWARF Standard must be
submitted using the [Public Comment](comment.html) page.
The [DWARF Discussion](mailto:dwarf-discuss@lists.dwarfstd.org)
mailing list can be used to ask questions about the DWARF Standard,
about implementation methods, or for other DWARF-related issues.

**All submissions are accepted under the following conditions:**

* Copyright on each submission is retained by its author,
  but the DWARF Standard Committee (and any successor) is
  granted the right to copy, modify, or adapt the submission
  for inclusion in the DWARF Standard, or on the web site
  or wiki, without limitation or additional notice.

* The submitter grants to the DWARF Standards Committee and
  any other party who may obtain the submission from the
  DWARF Standards Committee all rights to any proprietary
  interest they may have in the submission necessary to implement it in
  whole or part, whether the submission is incorporated into the
  Standard or not.

* All submissions are without any guarantee or
  warranty by the submitter or the DWARF Standards Committee.
  Neither submitter nor the DWARF Standards Committee accept
  liability for use of the submission in any form or reliance
  upon the accuracy or completeness of the submission.
