Introduction
------------

With the current DWARF format, the debug information is designed
with the expectation that it will be processed by the linker to
produce an output binary with complete debug information, and
with fully-resolved references to locations within the
application. For very large applications, however, this approach
can result in excessively large link times and excessively large
output files. Several vendors have independently developed
proprietary approaches that allow the debug information to remain
in the relocatable object files, so that the linker does not have
to process the debug information or copy it to the output file.
These approaches have all required that additional information be
made available to the debug information consumer, and that the
consumer perform some minimal amount of relocation in order to
interpret the debug info correctly. The additional information
required, in the form of load maps or symbol tables, and the
details of the relocation are not covered by the DWARF
specification, and vary with each vendor&#x27;s implementation.

For more background information, see the GCC wiki page at:

    http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission

This is the fourth in a series of proposals to extend the DWARF
specification to support the use of unlinked and unrelocated
debug information.

  * The first proposal introduces a mechanism for referring to
    strings indirectly, collecting the string offsets into a new
    section, and introducing a new form code for this purpose.

  * The second proposal introduces a similar indirect mechanism
    for referring to relocatable addresses in the loadable
    segments of the program, collecting all such addresses in a
    single section.

  * The third proposal introduces a mechanism for referring to
    range table entries in the .debug_ranges section with a
    single relocation per compilation unit rather than one for
    each reference.

  * This fourth proposal introduces a mechanism for splitting the
    DWARF debugging information into two sets of sections. One
    set remains in the relocatable object (.o) files, and is
    linked into the final executable; the other set is written to
    a non-relocatable DWARF object (.dwo) file, and remains in
    the build tree as an independent file where the debugger can
    reference it as needed.

  * The fifth proposal introduces a package file format for
    collecting the DWARF object (.dwo) files so that the
    debugging information can be easily saved and transported for
    debugging applications outside of the build tree.


Overview
--------

This proposal introduces an optional set of debugging sections
that allow the compiler to partition the debugging information
into a set of (small) sections that require link-time relocation
and a set of (large) sections that do not. The sections that
require relocation are written to the relocatable object file as
usual, and will be linked into the final executable. The sections
that do not require relocation, however, can be written to the
relocatable object (.o) file but ignored by the linker, or they
can be written to a separate DWARF object (.dwo) file.

The optional set of debugging sections includes the following:

  * .debug_info.dwo - Contains the DW_TAG_compile_unit DIE and
    its descendants. This is the bulk of the debugging
    information for the compilation unit that is normally found
    in .debug_info.

  * .debug_types.dwo - Contains the DW_TAG_type_unit DIEs and
    their descendants. This is the bulk of the debugging
    information for the type units that is normally found in
    .debug_types.

  * .debug_abbrev.dwo - Contains the abbreviations tables used by
    the .debug_info.dwo and .debug_types.dwo sections.

  * .debug_loc.dwo - Contains the location lists referenced by
    the debugging information entries in .debug_info.dwo. This
    contains the location lists normally found in .debug_loc,
    with a slightly modified format to eliminate the need for
    relocations.

  * .debug_str.dwo - Contains the string table for all indirect
    strings referenced by the debugging information in the
    .debug_info.dwo and .debug_types.dwo sections.

  * .debug_str_offsets.dwo - Contains the string offsets table
    for the strings in .debug_str.dwo. (See the first proposal in
    this series.)

  * .debug_macinfo.dwo - Contains macro definition information,
    normally found in .debug_macinfo.

  * .debug_line.dwo - Contains skeleton line tables for the type
    units in the .debug_types.dwo section. These line tables
    contain only the directory and files lists needed to
    interpret DW_AT_decl_file attributes in the debugging
    information entries. Actual line number tables remain in the
    .debug_line section, and remain in the relocatable object
    (.o) files.

[There is a current proposal to replace .debug_macinfo with a new
.debug_macro section. The format proposed there for the new
section will need some minor adjustments in order to eliminate
the need for relocations in that section, which will allow the
compiler to move the macro information to a non-relocatable
.debug_macinfo.dwo section.]

In order for the consumer to locate and process the debug
information, the compiler must produce a small amount of debug
information that will pass through the linker into the output
binary. A skeleton .debug_info section for each compilation unit
will contain a reference to the corresponding &quot;.o&quot; or &quot;.dwo&quot;
file, and the .debug_line section (which is typically small
compared to the .debug_info and .debug_types sections) will be
linked into the output binary, as will the new .debug_addr
section.

The debug sections that will continue to be linked into the
output binary include the following:

  * .debug_abbrev - Contains the abbreviation codes used by the
    skeleton .debug_info section.

  * .debug_info - Contains a skeleton DW_TAG_compile_unit DIE,
    but no children.

  * .debug_str - Contains any strings referenced by the skeleton
    .debug_info sections (via DW_FORM_strp or DW_FORM_strx).

  * .debug_str_offsets - Contains the string offsets table for
    the strings in .debug_str. (See the first proposal in this
    series.)

  * .debug_addr - Contains references to loadable sections,
    indexed by attributes of form DW_FORM_addr_index or location
    expression DW_OP_addr_index opcodes. (See the second proposal
    in this series.)

  * .debug_line - Contains the line number tables, unaffected by
    this proposal. (These could be moved to the .dwo file, but in
    order to do so, each DW_LNE_set_address opcode would need to
    be replaced by a new opcode that referenced an entry in the
    .debug_addr section. Furthermore, leaving this section in the
    .o file allows many debug info consumers to remain unaware of
    .dwo files.)

  * .debug_frame - Contains the frame tables, unaffected by this
    proposal.

  * .debug_ranges - Contains the range lists, unaffected by this
    proposal.

  * .debug_pubnames - Contains the public names for use in
    building an index section. This section will have the same
    format and use as always. The section header refers to a
    compilation unit offset, which will be the offset of the
    skeleton compilation unit in .debug_info.

  * .debug_pubtypes - Contains the public types for use in
    building an index section. This section will have the same
    format and use as always. The section header refers to a
    compilation unit offset, which will be the offset of the
    skeleton compilation unit in .debug_info.

  * .debug_aranges - Contains the accelerated range lookup table
    for the compilation unit, unaffected by this proposal.

The skeleton DW_TAG_compile_unit DIE has the following attributes:

  * DW_AT_comp_dir
  * DW_AT_dwo_name (new)
  * DW_AT_dwo_id (new)
  * DW_AT_stmt_list
  * DW_AT_low_pc (see note)
  * DW_AT_high_pc (see note)
  * DW_AT_ranges (see note)
  * DW_AT_ranges_base
  * DW_AT_addr_base

(If DW_AT_ranges is present, DW_AT_low_pc and DW_AT_high_pc are
not used, and vice versa.)

All other attributes of the compilation unit DIE can be moved to
the full DIE in the .debug_info.dwo section.

With the first two proposals in this series, most of the
relocations that would normally be found in the .debug_info.dwo
and .debug_types.dwo sections can be moved to the .debug_addr and
.debug_str_offsets.dwo sections. Those in the
.debug_str_offsets.dwo sections can simply be omitted because the
DWARF information in those sections will not be combined at link
time, so no relocation is necessary. With the third proposal,
many of the remaining relocations referring to range lists can be
eliminated. The relocations that remain fall into the following
categories:

  * References from compilation unit and type unit headers to the
    .debug_abbrev.dwo section. Because the new sections are not
    combined at link time, these references need no relocations.

  * References from DW_TAG_compile_unit DIEs to the
    .debug_line.dwo section, via DW_AT_stmt_list. This attribute
    will remain in the skeleton .debug_info section, so no
    relocation in the .debug_info.dwo section is necessary.

  * References from DW_TAG_type_unit DIEs to the skeleton
    .debug_line.dwo section, via DW_AT_stmt_list. Because the new
    sections are not combined at link time, these references need
    no relocations.

  * References from DW_TAG_compile_unit and DW_TAG_type_unit DIEs
    to the .debug_str_offsets.dwo section, via
    DW_AT_str_offsets_base. Because the new sections are not
    combined at link time, the DW_AT_str_offsets_base attribute
    is not required in a .debug_info.dwo or .debug_types.dwo
    section.

  * References from DW_TAG_compile_unit DIEs to the .debug_addr
    section, via DW_AT_addr_base. This attribute will remain in
    the skeleton .debug_info section, so no relocation in the
    .debug_info.dwo section is necessary.

  * References from DW_TAG_compile_unit DIEs to the .debug_ranges
    section, via DW_AT_ranges_base. This attribute will remain in
    the skeleton .debug_info section, so no relocation in the
    .debug_info.dwo section is necessary.

  * References from the .debug_loc.dwo section to machine addresses
    via a location list entry or a base address selection entry.
    With a minor change to the location list entry format,
    described below, these relocations can also be eliminated.

Each location list entry contains beginning and ending address
offsets, which normally may be relocated addresses. In the
.debug_loc.dwo section, these offsets are replaced by indices
into the .debug_addr section. Each location list entry will begin
with a single byte identifying the entry type:
DW_LLE_end_of_list_entry (0) indicates an end-of-list entry,
DW_LLE_base_address_selection_entry (1) indicates a base address
selection entry, DW_LLE_start_end_entry (2) indicates a normal
location list entry providing start and end addresses,
DW_LLE_start_length_entry (3) indicates a normal location list
entry providing a start address and a length, and
DW_LLE_offset_pair_entry (4) indicates a normal location list
entry providing start and end offsets relative to the base
address. An end-of-list entry has no further data. A base address
selection entry contains a single unsigned LEB128 number
following the entry type byte, which is an index into the
.debug_addr section that selects the new base address for
subsequent location list entries. A start/end entry contains two
unsigned LEB128 numbers following the entry type byte, which are
indices into the .debug_addr section that select the beginning
and ending addresses. A start/length entry contains one unsigned
LEB128 number and a 4-byte unsigned value (as would be
represented by the form code DW_FORM_const4u). The first number
is an index into the .debug_addr section that selects the
beginning offset, and the second number is the length of the
range. Addresses fetched from the .debug_addr section are not
relative to the base address. An offset pair entry contains two
4-byte unsigned values (as would be represented by the form code
DW_FORM_const4u), treated as the beginning and ending offsets,
respectively, relative to the base address. As in the .debug_loc
section, the base address is obtained either from the nearest
preceding base address selection entry, or, if there is no such
entry, from the compilation unit base address (as defined in
Section 3.1.1). For the latter three types (start/end,
start/length, and offset pair), the two operand values are
followed by a location description as in a normal location list
entry in the .debug_loc section.

This proposal depends on having an index of debugging information
available to the consumer. For name lookups, the consumer can use
the .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections (or an index
built at link time based on the information in those sections),
which will lead to a skeleton compilation unit. The
DW_AT_comp_dir and DW_AT_dwo_name attributes in the skeleton
compilation unit can then be used to locate the corresponding
DWARF object file for the compilation unit. Similarly, for an
address lookup, the consumer can use the .debug_aranges table,
which will also lead to a skeleton compilation unit. For a file
and line number lookup, the skeleton compilation units can be
used to locate the line number tables.

[For lookups by type signature, we are currently emitting
skeleton type units in the .o files, which lead to the
corresponding DWARF object files. These will be obviated by a new
proposal for improved accelerator tables, so we are not including
skeleton type units in this proposal.]


Changes to the DWARF Specification
----------------------------------

Section 2.1 (&quot;The Debugging Information Entry (DIE)&quot;)

Add the following paragraph at the end of the section:

    Optionally, debugging information may be partitioned such
    that the majority of the debugging information can remain in
    individual object files without being processed by the
    linker. These debugging information entries are contained in
    the .debug_info.dwo and .debug_types.dwo sections. These
    sections may be placed in the object file but marked so that
    the linker ignores them, or they may be placed in a separate
    DWARF object file that resides alongside the normal object
    file. See Section 7.x (&quot;Split DWARF Objects&quot;) for more
    information.

Section 2.2 (&quot;Attribute Types&quot;)

In Figure 2, add the following rows:

    Attribute name            Identifies or Specifies
    --------------            -----------------------
    DW_AT_dwo_name            Name of DWARF object file
    DW_AT_dwo_id              Unique signature for compilation
                              unit

Section 2.6.2 (&quot;Location Lists&quot;)

Add the following paragraphs to the end of the sections:

    In a split DWARF object (see Section 7.x), location lists
    are contained in the .debug_loc.dwo section, and have a
    slightly different format. Each entry in the location list
    begins with a type code, which is a single byte that
    identifies the type of entry. There are five types of entries:

    DW_LLE_end_of_list_entry
        This entry indicates the end of a location list, and
        contains no further data.

    DW_LLE_base_address_selection_entry
        This entry contains an unsigned LEB128 value immediately
        following the type code. This value is the index of an
        address in the .debug_addr section, which is then used as
        the base address when interpreting offsets in subsequent
        location list entries of type DW_LLE_offset_pair_entry.

    DW_LLE_start_end_entry
        This entry contains two unsigned LEB128 values
        immediately following the type code. These values are the
        indexes of two addresses in the .debug_addr section.
        These indicate the starting and ending addresses,
        respectively, that define the address range for which
        this location is valid. The starting and ending addresses
        given by this type of entry are not relative to the
        compilation unit base address.

    DW_LLE_start_length_entry
        This entry contains one LEB128 value and a 4-byte
        unsigned value immediately following the type code. The
        first value is the index of an address in the .debug_addr
        section, which marks the beginning of the address range
        over which the location is valid. The second value is the
        length of the range. The starting address given by this
        type of entry is not relative to the compilation unit
        base address.

    DW_LLE_offset_pair_entry
        This entry contains two 4-byte unsigned values
        immediately following the type code. These values are the
        starting and ending offsets, respectively, relative to
        the applicable base address, that define the address
        range for which this location is valid.

    For the last three types of entries, a single location
    description follows the fields that define the address range.

Section 3.1 (&quot;Unit Entries&quot;)

Add a new section after Section 3.1.1 (&quot;Normal and Partial
Compilation Unit Entries&quot;):

    3.1.x Skeleton Compilation Unit Entries

    When generating a split DWARF object (see Section 7.x), the
    compilation unit in the .debug_info section is a &quot;skeleton&quot;
    compilation unit, which contains only a subset of the
    attributes of the full compilation unit (in general, it
    contains those attributes that are necessary for the consumer
    to locate the DWARF object where the full compilation unit
    can be found, and for the consumer to interpret references to
    addresses in the program). A skeleton compilation unit has no
    children, and may have the following attributes:

    1.  Either a DW_AT_low_pc and DW_AT_high_pc pair of attributes
        or a DW_AT_ranges attribute (same as for regular
        compilation unit entries).

    2.  A DW_AT_stmt_list attribute (same as for regular
        compilation unit entries).

    3.  A DW_AT_comp_dir attribute (same as for regular
        compilation unit entries).

    4.  A DW_AT_dwo_name attribute whose value is a
        null-terminated string containing the full or relative
        path name of the DWARF object file that contains the full
        compilation unit.

    5.  A DW_AT_dwo_id attribute whose value is an 8-byte
        unsigned hash of the full compilation unit.  This hash
        value is computed by the method described in Section 7.27
        (&quot;Type Signature Computation&quot;).

    6.  A DW_AT_ranges_base attribute (same as for regular
        compilation unit entries).

    7.  A DW_AT_addr_base attribute (same as for regular
        compilation unit entries).

    All other attributes of a compilation unit entry (described
    in Section 7.1.1) should be placed in the full compilation
    unit entry in the .debug_info.dwo section of the split DWARF
    object. The attributes provided by the skeleton compilation
    unit entry do not need to be repeated in the full compilation
    unit entry, except for DW_AT_dwo_id, which should appear in
    both entries so that the consumer can verify that it has
    found the correct DWARF object.

Section 3.1.3 (&quot;Separate Type Unit Entries&quot;)

Add the following paragraph before the fourth paragraph
(beginning &quot;A type unit entry for a given type T...&quot;):

    A type unit entry may have a DW_AT_stmt_list attribute, whose
    value is a section offset to a line number table for this
    type unit. Because type units do not describe any code, they
    do not actually need a line number table, but the line number
    tables also contain a list of directories and file names that
    may be referenced by the DW_AT_decl_file attribute. In a
    normal object file with a regular compilation unit entry, the
    type unit entries can simply refer to the line number table
    used by the compilation unit. In a split DWARF object, where
    the type units are located in a separate DWARF object file,
    the DW_AT_stmt_list attribute should refer to a &quot;skeleton&quot;
    line number table in the .debug_line.dwo section, which
    contains only the list of directories and file names. All
    type unit entries in a split DWARF object may (but are not
    required to) refer to the same skeleton line number table.

Chapter 7 (&quot;Data Representation&quot;)

Add a new section after Section 7.3 (&quot;Executable Objects and
Shared Objects&quot;):

    7.x Split DWARF Objects

    A DWARF producer may partition the debugging
    information such that the majority of the debugging
    information can remain in individual object files without
    being processed by the linker. The first partition contains
    debugging information that must still be processed by the linker,
    and includes the following:

      * The line number tables, range tables, frame tables, and
        accelerated access tables, in the usual sections:
        .debug_line, .debug_ranges, .debug_frame,
        .debug_pubnames, .debug_pubtypes, and .debug_aranges,
        respectively.

      * An address table, in the .debug_addr section. This table
        contains all addresses and constants that require
        link-time relocation, and items in the table can be
        referenced indirectly from the debugging information via
        the DW_FORM_addrx form, and by the DW_OP_addrx and
        DW_OP_constx operators.

      * A skeleton compilation unit, as described in Section
        3.1.x, in the .debug_info section.

      * An abbreviations table for the skeleton compilation unit,
        in the .debug_abbrev section.

      * A string table, in the .debug_str section. The string
        table is necessary only if the skeleton compilation unit
        uses either indirect string form, DW_FORM_strp or
        DW_FORM_strx.

      * A string offsets table, in the .debug_str_offsets
        section. The string offsets table is necessary only if
        the skeleton compilation unit uses the DW_FORM_strx form.

    The second partition contains the debugging information that
    does not need to be processed by the linker. These sections
    may be left in the object files and ignored by the linker
    (i.e., not combined and copied to the executable object), or
    they may be placed by the producer in a separate DWARF object
    file. The attributes contained in the skeleton compilation
    unit can be used by a DWARF consumer to find the object file
    or DWARF object file. This partition includes the following:

      * The full compilation unit, in the .debug_info.dwo section.
        Attributes in debugging information entries may refer to
        machine addresses indirectly using the DW_FORM_addrx form,
        and location expressions may do so using the DW_OP_addrx and
        DW_OP_constx forms. Attributes may refer to range table
        entries with an offset relative to a base offset in the
        range table for the compilation unit.

      * Separate type units, in the .debug_types.dwo section.

      * Abbreviations table(s) for the compilation unit and type
        units, in the .debug_abbrev.dwo section.

      * Location lists, in the .debug_loc.dwo section.

      * A skeleton line table (for the type units), in the
        .debug_lines.dwo section (see Section 3.1.3).

      * Macro information, in the .debug_macinfo.dwo section.

      * A string table, in the .debug_str.dwo section.

      * A string offsets table, in the .debug_str_offsets.dwo
        section.

    Except where noted otherwise, all references in this document
    to a debugging information section (e.g., .debug_info),
    applies also to the corresponding split DWARF section (e.g.,
    .debug_info.dwo).

Section 7.5.4 (&quot;Attribute Encodings&quot;)

In Figure 20, add the following row to the table:

    Attribute name            Value    Classes
    --------------            -----    -------
    DW_AT_dwo_name            [TBA]    string
    DW_AT_dwo_id              [TBA]    constant

In Chapter 7, add a new section after Section 7.24:

7.xx Location List Table

    Each set of entries in the address table contained in the
    .debug_loc or .debug_loc.dwo section begins with a header
    containing:

        1.  unit_length (initial length)
            A 4-byte or 12-byte length containing the length of
            the set of entries for this compilation unit, not
            including the length field itself. In the 32-bit
            DWARF format, this is a 4-byte unsigned integer
            (which must be less than 0xfffffff0); in the 64-bit
            DWARF format, this consists of the 4-byte value
            0xffffffff followed by an 8-byte unsigned integer
            that gives the actual length (see Section 7.4).

        2.  version (uhalf)
            A 2-byte version identifier containing the value 1
            (see Appendix F).

        3.  address_size (ubyte)
            A 1-byte unsigned integer containing the size in
            bytes of an address (or the offset portion of an
            address for segmented addressing) on the target
            system.

        4.  segment_size (ubyte)
            A 1-byte unsigned integer containing the size in
            bytes of a segment selector on the target system.

    This header is followed by a series of range list entries as
    described in Section 2.6.2. The segment size is given by the
    segment_size field of the header, and the address size is
    given by the address_size field of the header. If the
    segment_size field in the header is zero, the segment
    selector is omitted from the location list entries.

    The entries are referenced by a byte offset relative to the
    first location list entry following this header.

Appendix A (&quot;Attributes by Tag Value&quot;)

In Figure 42, in the table entries for DW_TAG_compile_unit, add
DW_AT_dwo_name and DW_AT_dwo_id.

Appendix D (&quot;Examples&quot;)

Add the following section to the end of the appendix:

    D.13 Split DWARF Example

    [TBD]

Appendix F (&quot;DWARF Section Version Numbers&quot;)

In Figure 97, replace the row for .debug_loc with the following:

    Section Name      V2    V3    V4    V5
    ------------      --    --    --    --
    .debug_loc         x     x     x     5
