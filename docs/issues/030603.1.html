<pre class="proposal">
In the DWARF2 specification there was the following statement in section 
5.5.4 &quot;Structure Data Member Entries&quot;:

    &quot;If the member entry is defined in the structure or class
     body, it has a DW_AT_data_member_location attribute
     whose value is a location description that describes
     the location of that member relative to the base address
     of the structure, union, or class that most closely
     encloses the corresponding member declaration.&quot;

However in the DWARF3 draft 8 specification this has been reworded in 
section 5.6.6 &quot;Data Member Entries&quot; to read:

    &quot;For a data member of a structure, union or class, the
     corresponding member entry has a DW_AT_data_member_location
     attribute whose value describes the location of that
     member relative to the base address of the structure
     union, or class the most closely encloses the member
     declaration.&quot;



If we consider static data members the original DWARF2 wording allowed for 
the DW_AT_data_member_location attribute to be omitted (as the actual 
location would be defined in the corresponding DW_TAG_variables 
entry).      However the DWARF3 wording implies that there should always be 
a DW_AT_data_member_location attribute.

Is this new wording in the DWARF3 specification correct?


---------------------------
Others affirmed that Draft 8 seems wrong.


PROPOSAL:

Revert to the earlier sentence (change the sentence in 5.6.6
back to DWARF2 wording).

-------------------------------------------------------------

Accepted with following modification:

Replacing the new text with the old text isn&#x27;t such a good idea,
but adding a &quot;for a data member defined in a structure&quot; addition
would be good.
