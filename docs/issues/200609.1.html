Section Several, pg 25, 43, 44, 51, 52, 53, 148, 164

Motivation:

The DWARF standard generally assumes that described entities exist in
the final executable; however, various linker operations may result in
cases where this is not true, leaving addresses pointing to unfriendly
places.  In most cases linkers will fix up undefined symbols to 0x0,
however this is a valid address on many targets.  We should have a way
to indicate that an address is invalid, i.e., a &quot;tombstone&quot; value that
is not interpreted as a real address.

Discussion:

Section 2.17 &quot;Code Addresses, Ranges and Base Addresses&quot; p.51 line 29
says:
  If an entity has no associated machine code, none of these attributes
  are specified.
(&quot;These attributes&quot; are DW_AT_low_pc, DW_AT_high_pc, or DW_AT_ranges.)

That&#x27;s fine for a compiler emitting an entry for something that has no
associated code (e.g., declaration or abstract instance).  But there
are cases where the compiler emits code, and the linker strips it. I&#x27;m
aware of three situations where this can occur:
- functions emitted in COMDAT sections, typically C++ template
  instantiations or inline functions from a header file;
- deduplicating different functions with identical content; GNU refers
  to this as ICF (Identical Code Folding);
- functions with no callers; sometimes called dead-stripping or
  garbage collection.

In the first two cases, multiple copies of the &quot;same&quot; function will
be removed, and only one copy retained in the final executable; in the
third case, no copies are retained.

In these cases, the compiler will of course emit attributes pointing
to each function&#x27;s code, and it&#x27;s the linker who strips the code.  It
seems unrealistic to ask the linker to rewrite the DWARF to remove the
attributes; instead, the linker will simply &quot;do something&quot; with the
relocations associated with the address/range attributes.

One can argue that all DIE references to deduplicated functions can be
fixed up to the one retained copy; however, that leaves entries in
multiple CUs pointing to the same code, including the DW_AT_ranges for
the CUs themselves.  It does not seem like a good idea to have multiple
CUs claiming ownership of the same range of instructions.  Similarly the
.debug_aranges section could be left in an unfortunate state; it is not
supposed to have overlapping or duplicate ranges.

And of course in the dead-stripping case, there is no retained copy to
point to.

The solution that Sony has adopted in its proprietary linker, and the
solution we have proposed for the LLVM project&#x27;s &#x27;LLD&#x27; linker, is to
fix up references to removed functions to &quot;-1&quot;, or as prior DWARF
versions described it in the base-address-selection entry of a range,
&quot;The value of the largest representable address offset (for example,
0xffffffff when the size of an address is 32 bits).&quot;

DWARF v5 no longer uses this special value for ranges, but it seems
very useful to have a standard &quot;tombstone&quot; value for the above cases.


Proposal:


At the end of page 25, add:

2.4.1 Reserved Target Address for a Non-Existent Entity

  The target address consisting of the largest representable address
  value (for example, 0xffffffff for a 32-bit address) is reserved to
  indicate that there is no entity designated by that address.

  *In some cases a producer may emit machine code or allocate
  storage for an entity, but a linker or other subsequent processing
  step may remove that entity. In that case, rather than be required
  to rewrite the DWARF description to eliminate the relevant DWARF
  construct that contains the address of that entity, the processing
  step may simply update the address value to the reserved value.*

Section 2.6.2, &quot;Location Lists&quot;, page 43, line 28, insert the following:

  In the case of a bounded location description where the range is defined
  by a starting address and either an ending address or a length, a
  starting address consisting of the reserved address value (see Section
  2.4.1) indicates a non-existent range, which is equivalent to omitting
  the description.

Section 2.6.2, &quot;Location Lists&quot;, page 44, following line 9 insert:

  If the base address is the reserved target address, either explicitly
  or by default, then the range of any bounded location description
  defined relative to that base address is non-existent, which is
  equivalent to omitting the description.

Section 2.17 &quot;Code Addresses, Ranges and Base Addresses&quot;, page 51, line 29
Replace the paragraph:

  If an entity has no associated machine code, none of these attributes
  are specified.

with the following:

  If a producer emits no machine code for an entity, none of these
  attributes are specified. Equivalently, a producer may emit such an
  attribute using the reserved target address (see Section 2.4.1) for the
  non-existent entity.

Section 2.17.3, &quot;Non-Contiguous Address Ranges&quot;, page 52, insert following
line 33:

  In the case of a range list entry where the range is defined by a
  starting address and either an ending address or a length, a starting
  address consisting of the reserved address value (see Section 2.4.1)
  indicates a non-existent range, which is equivalent to omitting the
  description.

Section 2.17.3, &quot;Non-Contiguous Address Ranges&quot;, page 53, following line 9
insert:

  If the base address is the reserved target address, either explicitly or
  by default, then the range of any range list entry defined relative to
  that base address is non-existent, which is equivalent to omitting the
  range list entry.

Section 6.1.2, &quot;Lookup By Address&quot;, page 148, following line 18, insert:

  A range description entry whose address is the reserved address (see
  Section 2.4.1), indicates a non-existent range, which is equivalent to
  omitting the range description.

Section 6.2.5.3, &quot;Extended Opcodes&quot;, page 164, following line 32 append:

  If the address value is the reserved target address (see Section 2.4.1
  on page 25), no instructions are associated with subsequent rows up to
  but not including the subsequent DW_LNE_set_address or
  DW_LNE_end_sequence opcode, which is equivalent to omitting that range
  of opcodes.
