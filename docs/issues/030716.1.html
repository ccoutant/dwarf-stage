<pre class="proposal">
What&#x27;s the definition of the phrase &quot;first sibling&quot;?  Does it mean the first
child of a node or the immediate next sibling of a node?  Section 3.7 &quot;Try
and Catch Block Entries&quot; has the sentence:

  &quot;The first sibling of each try block entry will be a catch block entry.&quot;

But the definition of first sibling isn&#x27;t well defined (or I couldn&#x27;t find
it).  It seems to me to make most sense that the definition here means &quot;the
immediate next sibling&quot; of a node as this seems to better match C++ syntax.
But if I ask myself independently what a &quot;first sibling&quot; is in DWARF I&#x27;m not
as sure.

------------
[Brian Nettleton responds to comment by David Anderson]
Good, this agrees with my interpretation of &quot;first sibling&quot; in this sentence
as well!  I didn&#x27;t actually propose &quot;immediate next sibling&quot;.  If I were to
propose a change it would be to simply remove the word first to make the
sentence:

  &quot;The sibling of each try block entry will be a catch block entry.&quot;

Which I think still makes the same point.  (Note that the last sentence in
section 2.3 also uses the phrase &quot;the sibling&quot; to mean what I&#x27;ve been
calling &quot;immediate next sibling&quot;--it couldn&#x27;t possibly mean anything else in
section 2.3 and I don&#x27;t think it could mean anything else here either).  Of
course as long as we&#x27;re all in agreement as to what the sentence means then
we&#x27;re ok.  Of course the only reason I&#x27;ve brought this up was because the
sentence at least confused a colleague and outside of the context of the
sentence in 3.7, I&#x27;m not really sure what I would define &quot;first sibling&quot; to
be (although I agree with you at the moment too!).


Chris Quenelle:

&gt;   &quot;The first sibling of each try block entry will be a catch block entry.&quot;

Putting on my tech writer hat I would have to say that
&quot;first sibling&quot; is confusing.

Use &quot;next sibling&quot; or &quot;following sibling&quot; to be more clear.

In english, &quot;first&quot; (when used by itself) is normally used to specify 
an absolute position.  &quot;next&quot; is used for relative positioning.


-------------------------------
PROPOSAL:

Change Sec 3.7 sentence to what Brian suggests:
  &quot;The sibling of each try block entry will be a catch block entry.&quot;

Suggestion:  &quot;The sibling following any try block entry will be a 
  catch block entry.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------

Modified text: 
&quot;The siblings following any try block entry will be its catch block entries.&quot;
