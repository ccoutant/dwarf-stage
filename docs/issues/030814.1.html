Chris Quenelle started the discussion with a question.

and answered. I *think* this is the extraction of a possible
document change, or at least a hint of one. -- David Anderson

&gt; It seems that with the addition of the DW_TAG_partial_unit tag, the
&gt; term &quot;compilation unit&quot; becomes a little ambiguous (at least to me).
&gt; Does &quot;compilation unit&quot; still refer to any block of data in the
&gt; .debug_info section, that has CU-header?  (I think of these as &quot;CU-blocks&quot;
&gt; What term do I use to describe the connected tree of dies that
&gt; originates inside one DW_TAG_compile_unit and spans several CU-blocks?
&gt; (I think of this as &quot;the information for an object file (.o file)&quot;)

Ron Brender
|Unfortunately there is a awkward vocabulary problem here. At the time we
|introduced DW_TAG_partial_unit we debated whether the term &quot;compilation
|unit&quot; should include partial units or not. In favor of being inclusive
|is the fact that something like 90% of the statements throughout that DWARF
|spec that refer to &quot;compilation units&quot; are true of both DW_TAG_compile_unit
|and DW_TAG_partial_unit. If compilation unit was not inclusive, then
|we would need to add &quot;and partial units&quot; in lots of places. So we went
|with the inclusive concept. In retrospect that may have been the wrong
|decision. We should probably revisit that choice at the next opportunity.
|(Note: this is not a substantive issue, &quot;merely&quot; one of presentation.)

&gt;&gt; In this paragraph, it&#x27;s not clear what &quot;ordinary compilation unit&quot;
&gt;&gt; means.
&gt;
&gt;An &quot;ordinary compilation unit&quot; would be one which contained descriptions
&gt;of all entities from it&#x27;s source or include files, without using any of
&gt;the space compression techniques in Appendix E.

|The complaint about the undefined phrase and the suggested definition
|are both right on. Perhaps we can work that definition into the document...

PROPOSAL: none at this time
