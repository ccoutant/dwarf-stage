Section Many, pg Many
Background:

Taking an action item from the DWARF committee as a result of the
discussion of issue 161122.1, I investigated the usefulness of having
fixed-size variants of DW_FORM_addrx.  Using the same two applications
(clang built with gcc, and a game built with clang) I found that something
under 4% of DIEs would become variable-size by switching from DW_FORM_addr
to DW_FORM_addrx.  While not as impressive as the case for fixed-size
variants of DW_FORM_strx, it still seems worthwhile to pursue this.

A bit more data crunching showed that over 90% of the CUs in the game
would be able to use a 1-byte index for all of their FORM_addrx needs,
and no CU in either application would need more than a 2-byte fixed size
index.  (Only 6 CUs out of over 4000 in the samples would have required 
using a 3-byte ULEB index).

So, while DW_FORM_addr is not as popular as DW_FORM_strp (by an order of
magnitude or more) it still seems worthwhile to devote a couple of forms
to fixed-size indexes into the address table.


Textual changes (referencing the DWARF 5 public review draft):

(This is the substantive bit:)

Section 7.5.5 p.211 (class address) 2nd sub-bullet
    Rewrite the bullet as follows:
    - An indirect index into a table of addresses (as described in the
      previous bullet) in the .debug_addr section of the object file.
      Each index is interpreted as a zero-based index into this table,
      relative to the value of the DW_AT_addr_base attribute of the
      associated compilation unit.  There are three forms for this index:
      a one-byte index (DW_FORM_addrx1), a two-byte index (DW_FORM_addrx2),
      and a variable length unsigned LEB128 index (DW_FORM_addrx).


(Everything else is an editorial/mechanical change to list the new forms.)

Section 1.4 p.9 (list of Version 5 changes) 2nd bullet:
    Add DW_FORM_addrx1 and DW_FORM_addrx2 after DW_FORM_addrx.

Section 3.1.1 p.65 item 14 (DW_AT_addr_base description)
    Add DW_FORM_addrx1 and DW_FORM_addrx2 after DW_FORM_addrx.

Section 7.3.2.1 p.187 second bullet (&quot;An address table...&quot;)
    &#x27;via the DW_FORM_addrx form&#x27;
 =&gt; &#x27;via the DW_FORM_addrx, DW_FORM_addrx1, and DW_FORM_addrx2 forms&#x27;

Section 7.3.2.2 p.188 first bullet
    &#x27;using the DW_FORM_addrx form, which accesses&#x27;
 =&gt; &#x27;using the DW_FORM_addrx, DW_FORM_addrx1, or DW_FORM_addrx2 forms,
     which access&#x27;

Section 7.5.6 table 7.6 p.219
    Add DW_FORM_addrx1 and DW_FORM_addrx2 (class address)

Appendix B figure B.1 p.272
    Somehow squeeze DW_FORM_addrx1 and DW_FORM_addrx2 into the box
    where DW_FORM_addrx is now, or defer the list to note (k)

Appendix B, note (k) to figure B.1, p.274
    Add DW_FORM_addrx1 and DW_FORM_addrx2 after DW_FORM_addrx.

Appendix B, note (k) to figure B.2, p.279
    Add DW_FORM_addrx1 and DW_FORM_addrx2 after DW_FORM_addrx.

Appendix F.1 p.391 second bullet (.debug_addr)
    Add DW_FORM_addrx1 and DW_FORM_addrx2 after DW_FORM_addrx.

Appendix F.1 p.392 item 3
    &#x27;the DW_FORM_addrx form&#x27;
 =&gt; &#x27;the DW_FORM_addrx, DW_FORM_addrx1, or DW_FORM_addrx2 forms&#x27;

Appendix F.2.2 p.399 first paragraph
    There&#x27;s a sentence in the middle of that paragraph starting
    &#x27;All attributes in demo1.dwo that use DW_FORM_addrx...&#x27;
 =&gt; &#x27;...use DW_FORM_addrx, DW_FORM_addrx1, or DW_FORM_addrx2...&#x27;

Appendix F.2.3 p.400 third bullet
    &#x27;use the form code DW_FORM_addrx,&#x27;
 =&gt; &#x27;use one of the form codes DW_FORM_addrx, DW_FORM_addrx1, or
     DW_FORM_addrx2,&#x27;
