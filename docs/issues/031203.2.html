UPC is a new language based on C.

(Documentation then the UPC Quick reference card may be a good place
to start, or maybe &quot;Getting started with UPC&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t start with
the formal spec !)


&gt; It seems that UPC is really a language extension and not a
&gt; whole new language, or a &quot;level&quot; of a standard language.

Not really.

Although the initial description for users can be condensed into a
small space the full specification remains quite large, and the
implementation is non-trivial (talk to Larry Meadows if you want some
in Sun experience).

The current UPC standard is extensions ISO-C. I cannot imagine anyone
now starting a UPC implementation which was UPC extensions to an older
C dialect.

&gt; Perhaps you want to know, before reading the rest of the tags,
&gt; whether the CU might contain UPC extensions.

But surely you know this from the fact that the language is DW_LANG_Upc.

&gt; If that&#x27;s the case, it might be better to have a &quot;language_extensions&quot;
&gt; tag, which can contain child tags naming specific extensions.
&gt;
&gt; But is that really necessary?

I don&#x27;t believe so. IMO UPC is best treated as a different language
from C. And, in any case DWARF has already taken the view that the
different dialects of C you cited (which are _more_ similar than C and
UPC) are best treated as different languages, so there seems little
reason to change that model on account of UPC.


PROPOSAL:

add the new language code
   DW_LANG_Upc   0x12 or whatever is the next value in the table (sec 7.12).
