Section: 7.21
Page: 155

I am implementing DWARF2/3 for some architectures with segmented
memories (in fact some single/dual harward architectures and we
use the segment to encode the memory and paging characteristics
of each address).
The part I find unclear is how to figure out the exact byte size
of each segmented address (in a tupple). This information is
required when writting in a generic DWARF2/3 parser that does
not know all the details of each architecure.

On page 155 of the DWARF3 document:

&gt; &gt;  4. address_size (ubyte)
&gt; &gt;       A 1-byte unsigned integer containing the size in bytes of an
&gt; &gt;       address (or the offset portion of an address for segmented
&gt; &gt;       addressing) on the target system.
&gt; &gt;  5. segment_size (ubyte)
&gt; &gt;       A 1-byte unsigned integer containing the size in bytes of a
&gt; &gt;       segment descriptor on the target system. This header is
&gt; &gt;       followed by a series of tuples.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Each tuple consists of an address and a length, each in the size
&gt; &gt; appropriate for an address on the target architecture. The first
&gt; &gt; tuple following the header in each set begins at an offset that
&gt; &gt; is a multiple of the size of a single tuple (that is, twice the
&gt; &gt; size of an address).

The definition of &#x27;address_size&#x27; and &#x27;segment_size&#x27; seems to imply
that the byte size of an address is &#x27;address_size+segment_size&#x27;.

However, the next paragraph defines it as &#x27;the size appropriate
for an address on the target architecture&#x27; which would make it
architecture dependant (and potentially, higher
than address_size+segment_size).

A typical example, could be an architecture using 16bit addresses
with a 8bit segment but storing a segmented address in 32bit.

It also make sense to enforce that that the physical size of
an address in the tupple should be a power of 2. This is
likely to be required anyways because of the alignment
constraints of the .debug_aranges sections (at least in ELF).

With that requirement, the ambiguity about the size of an
address in a tupple could be lifted by stating that

 (proposal 1) Each byte size of an address in a tupple is exactly
   &#x27;address_size+segment_size&#x27; bytes. That number should be a
   power of two.

 (proposal 2) The byte size of an address in a tupple is
   &#x27;address_size+segment_size&#x27; bytes rounded up to the closest
   power of two.


It should be noted that the exact encoding of a segmented
address is not fully specified. In practice, that could
mean that the definition of &#x27;0&#x27; for the end markers is also
not fully specified. For example, there are multiple ways to represent
the flat address 0 using an intel 16bit+16bit segmented addresses.
A safer definition for the end marker could be &quot;a tupple with all
bytes set to 0&quot;.

------------------

The intent of the DWARF standard is that the tuple quoted from page
155 should be &lt;segment, address, length&gt; to be consistent with
usage elsewhere in the document.  The use of &quot;address&quot; on a segmented
architecture indicates the offset within the segment.  There are no
places where &quot;address&quot; is intended to mean &lt;segment,offset&gt;.  

The size of the tuples of &lt;segment, address, length&gt; do not need to
be a power of two.
