Re: Section 2.5.4, Page: 24

As previously posted to the mailing list, i&#x27;m just submitting it as an &quot;official public comment&quot;

The standard currently specifies that the end address of a location list
entry *must* be greater than the beginning address (except for the
location list terminator):

&quot;2. An ending address, again relative to the applicable base address of
the compilation unit referencing this location list. It marks the first
address past the end of the address range over which the location is
valid. The ending address must be greater than the beginning address.&quot;

This causes significant problems for gcc 4.0 when trying to produce
location lists (and i assume other producers have the same problem,
whether they know it or not).

The reason is that we (being gcc and others that genreate debug info in 
the compiler, not the assembler or linker) can&#x27;t know, at a minimum until 
well after we&#x27;ve output the assembly code (at a minimum, we can&#x27;t know 
until the assembly file is assembled), whether the two labels we&#x27;ve put 
in our IL, and that get output to the assembly,will actually have two 
different addresses in memory.

This is in part because the backend may decide, when expanding the
instructions to assembly, not to actually output anything for a given
instruction, at assembly output time.  So there is no way to know where
to put the label such that it is at least 1 greater than begin label.

There is also the case when the user uses inline assembly (in which case
we just paste their inline assembly into the right place in the
assembler file), and their inline assembly may or may not have actual
instructions in it.

So we can, and do, end up with the following assembly:

LVL2 &lt;---- location list begin address label
L3:  
LVL3 &lt;--- location list end address label


..
LLST1:
...
        .long   .LVL2-.Ltext0   # Location list begin address (*.LLST1)
        .long   .LVL3-.Ltext0   # Location list end address (*.LLST1)
        .value  0x1     # Location expression size
        .byte   0x51    # DW_OP_reg1
...
        .long   .LVL4-.Ltext0   # Location list begin address (*.LLST1)
        .long   .LFE2-.Ltext0   # Location list end address (*.LLST1)
        .value  0x1     # Location expression size
        .byte   0x51    # DW_OP_reg1
        .long   0x0     # Location list terminator begin (*.LLST1)
        .long   0x0     # Location list terminator end (*.LLST1)


Note that this location list entry becomes invalid when assembled,
though we can&#x27;t determine this at the time when we output it.

Besides this, things can get worse if your assembler does any
optimization and goes to update the debug info.  It now has to try to
prove that the addresses are different in order to keep the entry there,
otherwise it would have to presumptively delete it to keep the info
valid and we lose possibly valuable information.
Same with the linker.

This all seems harsh, and for the convience of the consumer.
The final consumer of this debug info could simply ignore location list
entries that have the same begin and end address, without any trouble at
all.

Therefore, i&#x27;d like to propose that the standard explicitly allow the
begin and end address to be the same for a location list entry, and in
that case, the consumer should simply ignore it.

This is not optimal from a space perspective, but this is a matter of
something that is simply impossible for a producer to always get right.

PROPOSAL:

    *A location list entry (but not a base address selection or end of
    list entry) whose beginning and ending addresses are equal has no
    effect because the size of the range covered by such an entry is
    zero.*

Also, make a similar addition regarding a range list entry in Section
2.16.3.
