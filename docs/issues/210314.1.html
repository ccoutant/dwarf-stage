<pre class="proposal">
Section various, page various.

Goal  of the changes:
Eliminate all indefinite antecedents in the DWARF5 standard (places
where the word &#x27;it&#x27; is unclear in what the word refers to).

=====
General comments

While there are well over 200 lines in the document using the word  &#x27;it&#x27;, I could 
only find seven that seem to have the possibility of misinterpretation.

Elimination of the ambiguity is straighforward: Replace &#x27;it&#x27; with intended 
reference wording.

Here are seven changes editor may find it worthwhile implementing.  In a few cases 
here one might need to refer to the document to see the &#x27;indefiniteness&#x27;
of the antecedent.

Document lines here were reformatted to fit shorter lines for presentation as an 
ISSUE.

The Editor suggested I present all these as one issue.  Here numbered IND 1 through 
IND 7.  IND stands for Indeterminate.

The changes

IND 1:Page 10 lines 10-14
In a string type, the DW_AT_byte_size attribute is re-defined to always describe the
size of the string type. (Previously it described the size of the optional string 
length data field if the DW_AT_string_length attribute was also present.) In addition, 
the DW_AT_string_length attribute may now refer directly to an object that contains 
the length value.

IND 2: Page 163, lines 33-36
Note that the function to which the prologue end applies cannot be directly determined
from the line number information alone; it must be determined in combination with the
subroutine information entries of the compilation (including inlined subroutines).

IND 3: Page 164 lines 33-34
All of the other line number program opcodes that affect the address register add a 
delta to it. This instruction stores a relocatable value into it instead.

IND 4: Page 170 lines 20-23
The DW_MACRO_import entry instructs the consumer to replicate the sequence of 
entries following the target macro header which begins at the given .debug_macro 
offset, up to, but excluding, the terminating entry with opcode 0, as though it 
occurs in place of the import operation.

IND 5: Page 172 lines 33-35
The CFA column defines the rule which computes the Canonical Frame Address value; 
it may be either a register and a signed offset that are added together, or a DWARF
expression that is evaluated.

IND 6: Page 347 lines 2-4
If the compiler determines that the value of an object is constant (either throughout
the program, or within a specific range), it may choose to materialize that constant
only when used, rather than store it in memory or in a register.

IND 7: Page 405 lines 20-22
This section has a similar format to the .debug_loclists section in a non-split object,
but it has some small differences as explained in Section 7.7.3 on page 226.
