<pre class="proposal">
Background:

There is some inconsistency in the usage of the terms &quot;segment&quot; and
&quot;address&quot; in the DWARF standard.  A discussion of this can be found
in &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.dwarfstd.org/pipermail/dwarf-workgroup-dwarfstd.org/2007-March/000312.html&quot;&gt;DWARF v3&#x27;s use of Segments&lt;/a&gt;.

Proposal:

In section 2.12, &quot;Segmented Addresses&quot;:

- Use the term &#x27;segment selector&#x27; instead of &#x27;segment value&#x27;.

In section 6.1.2, &quot;Lookup by Address&quot;:

- Change item 5 to use the term &#x27;segment selector&#x27; instead of &#x27;segment
  descriptor&#x27;.

- Change the paragraph after the enumeration of the header values to
  read:

    This header is followed by a variable number of address range
    descriptors.  Each descriptor is a triple consisting of a segment
    selector, the beginning address within that segment of a range of
    text or data covered by some entry owned by the corresponding
    compilation unit, and the non-zero length of that range.  A
    particular set is terminated by an entry consisting of three
    zeroes.  (When the &#x27;segment_size&#x27; value in the set&#x27;s header is
    zero, the segment selector is effectively omitted from all
    entries, including the terminating entry.)  By scanning the table,
    a debugger can quickly decide which compilation unit to look in to
    find the debugging information for an object that has a given
    address.

Perhaps the parenthetical comment could be moved to a rationale
paragraph after this one, if the paragraph above would be clear enough
with it moved.

In section 7.3, &quot;Executable Objects and Shared Objects&quot;:

- Change the first paragraph to read:

    The relocated addresses in the debugging information for an
    executable object are virtual addresses and the relocated
    addresses in the debugging information for a shared object are
    offsets relative to the start of the lowest region of memory
    loaded from that shared object.

  (This avoids using the word &#x27;segment&#x27; in an inconsistent way.)

In section 7.20, &quot;Address Range Table&quot;:

- Change item 5 to use the term &#x27;segment selector&#x27; instead of &#x27;segment
  descriptor&#x27;.

- Change the paragraph after the enumeration of the header values to
  read:

    This header is followed by a series of tuples. Each tuple consists
    of a segment, an address and a length.  The segment&#x27;s size is
    given by the &#x27;segment_length&#x27; field of the header; the address and
    length are each of the size given by the &#x27;address_length&#x27; field of
    the header.  The first tuple following the header in each set
    begins at an offset that is a multiple of the size of a single
    tuple (that is, the size of a segment selector, plus twice the
    size of an address).  The header is padded, if necessary, to the
    appropriate boundary. Each set of tuples is terminated by a 0 for
    the segment, 0 for the address and 0 for the length.  If the
    header&#x27;s &#x27;segment_length&#x27; field is zero, the segment selectors are
    omitted from all tuples, including the terminating tuple.
