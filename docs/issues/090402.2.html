<pre class="proposal">
In section 5.7 Condition Entries, the normative text currently reads:

    The DW_TAG_condition debugging information entry describes a COBOL
    level-88 condition.  If a name has been given to the condition, the
    condition entry has a DW_AT_name attribute whose value is a null-
    terminated string giving the condition name as it appears in the
    source program.

    The condition entry&#x27;s parent entry describes the conditional
    variable; normally this will be a DW_TAG_variable or DW_TAG_member
    entry.  The type of the condition entry is derived from the
    DW_AT_type attribute of the parent entry.

    The condition entry owns DW_TAG_constant and/or DW_TAG_subrange_type
    entries that describe the constant values associated with the
    condition.  If any child entry has a DW_AT_type attribute, that
    attribute should describe a type compatible with the type derived
    from the condition entry&#x27;s parent.

There are a few problems with this description.

1. The type &quot;derived from&quot; the parent is not well defined. In particular
   what happens when the parent has an array type is not specified, and
   it needs to be because it&#x27;s not obvious.

2. The &quot;type of the condition entry&quot; is actually best described as
   boolean, and is not interesting (so don&#x27;t bother describing it at
   all).  What matters is the relationship between the type of the
   conditional variable and the type(s) of the constant(s).

3. Normative text explicitly mentions COBOL.

I propose to replace the normative text with the following.

    The DW_TAG_condition debugging information entry describes a logical
    condition that tests whether a given data item&#x27;s value matches one
    of a set of constant values.  If a name has been given to the
    condition, the condition entry has a DW_AT_name attribute whose
    value is a null-terminated string giving the condition name as it
    appears in the source program.

    The condition entry&#x27;s parent entry describes the conditional
    variable; normally this will be a DW_TAG_variable, DW_TAG_member or
    DW_TAG_formal_parameter entry.  If the parent entry has an array
    type, the condition can test any invididual element, but not the
    array as a whole.  The condition entry implicitly specifies a
    &quot;comparison type&quot; that is the type of an array element if the parent
    has an array type, otherwise it is the type of the parent entry.

    The condition entry owns DW_TAG_constant and/or DW_TAG_subrange_type
    entries that describe the constant values associated with the
    condition.  If any child entry has a DW_AT_type attribute, that 
    attribute should describe a type compatible with the comparison type;
    otherwise the child&#x27;s type is the same as the comparison type.

The non-normative text would remain as is.
