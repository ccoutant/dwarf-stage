<h1>DWARF Debugging Information Format Committee Member Participation Agreement</h1>
<p><em>(Draft) April 16, 2021</em></p>
<p>The DWARF Committee <a href="bylaws.html">bylaws</a> article 2 item 3 states:
“Members shall be active participants in the development and extension
of the DWARF Debugging Format.” Members specifically agree to do the
following things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abide by the bylaws and any other policies and practices adopted
    by the Committee, including the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p><em>The bylaws, policies, and practices (including this Agreement) are
available to the public on the <a href="index.html">website</a>. Enforcement of
all of these is at the discretion of the Executive Committee.
<a href="bylaws.html">Bylaws</a> article 8 item 1 requires that (a) members
affirm they have authority to act on behalf of an employer they
represent, (b) all submissions or contributions are without license
or other encumbrance.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attend the majority of Committee meetings.</p>
<p><em>These are typically held “remotely” via telephone or video conference
call; this is our primary forum for discussions and decisions about
DWARF issues. Meetings may also have other kinds of business. Inform
the Chair of any planned absences or technical difficulties.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively participate in committee discussions (no “wallflowers”).</p>
<p><em>We produce the best results when we have to understand and address
various perspectives and viewpoints. It is especially valuable to ask
questions or speak up about topics that you did not initiate. That
said, we try to keep discussions focused on the topic at hand.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be willing to champion issues.</p>
<p><em><a href="issues.html">Issues</a> may be filed by anyone; each issue has a
designated (preferably volunteer) champion on the Committee, who will
present it to us for discussion. That might include re-drafting the
issue to conform to current Committee practices. The final form of
any changes to the DWARF specification remains the responsibility of
the Editor.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate on the dwarf-workgroup mailing list.</p>
<p><em>This members-only list is where we discuss topics outside of business
meetings. Topics might include issues before the Committee; ideas
that might result in new issues being filed; and any other relevant
topics. People often post revisions to their issues on the mailing
list, which helps everyone stay current; of course the
<a href="index.html">website</a> has the definitive content for each issue.
Committee meeting announcements, agendas, and minutes are also posted
to the mailing list.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Attendance is recorded in the minutes, and champions are listed on
the website. There is no formal tracking for anything else.</p>
