<h1>DWARF Debugging Information Format Committee Bylaws</h1>

<h2>Article 1. Organization Name and Purpose</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The name of the organization is the DWARF Debugging Information
   Format Committee (“Committee”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the organization is to standardize the DWARF
   Debugging Format, a data format used to support source level
   debugging for a number of different programming languages. The
   primary result of the Committee is the publication of various
   versions of the DWARF Debugging Format Standard (“Standards”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Committee’s goals are to extend the DWARF Debugging Format to
   improve its ability to support different programming languages and
   computer architectures, to correct and clarify the existing
   Standards, and to promote the use of the DWARF Debugging Format
   within the compiler and debugger development community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Materials produced by the Committee, such as Standards, are to be
   made available to the general public.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Article 2. Membership</h2>

   unaffected.</p>
