<h1>DWARF Version 5 Standard Released</h1>
<h2>February 15, 2017</h2>
<p>The DWARF Debugging Information Format Standards Committee
is pleased to announce
the availability of Version 5 of the DWARF Debugging Format
Standard.   The DWARF Debugging Format is used to communicate debugging
information between a compiler and debugger to make it easier for programmers to
develop, test, and debug programs.</p>
<p>DWARF is used by a wide range of compilers and debuggers, both proprietary and
open source, to support debugging of Ada, C, C++, Cobol, FORTRAN, Java, and
other programming languages. DWARF V5 adds support for new languages like Rust,
Swift, Ocaml, Go, and Haskell, as well as support for new features in older
languages.  DWARF can be used with a wide range of processor architectures, such
as x86, ARM, PowerPC, from 8-bit to 64-bit.</p>
<p>DWARF is the standard debugging format for Linux and several versions of Unix
and is widely used with embedded processors. DWARF is designed to be extended
easily to support new languages and new architectures.</p>
<p>The DWARF Version 5 Standard has been in development for six years.  DWARF
Committee members include representatives from over a dozen major companies
with extensive experience in compiler and debugger development.  Version 5
incorporates improvements in many areas:  better data compression, separation
of debugging data from executable files, improved description of macros and
source files, faster searching for symbols, improved debugging of optimized code,
as well as numerous improvements in functionality and performance.</p>
<p>The DWARF Version 5 Standard can be downloaded without charge from the DWARF
website (<a href="https://dwarfstd.org">dwarfstd.org</a>).
Additional information about DWARF, including how to subscribe to the DWARF
mailing list, can also be found on the website.</p>
