<h1>DWARF Debugging Information Format Committee Code of Conduct</h1>
<p><em>April 14, 2021</em></p>
<p>The DWARF Debugging Information Format community has always worked to be
a welcoming and respectful community, and we want to ensure that doesn’t
change as we grow and evolve. To that end, we have a few ground rules
that we ask people to adhere to:</p>
<ul>
<li>be friendly and patient, be welcoming,</li>
<li>be considerate,</li>
<li>be respectful,</li>
<li>be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others, and when
  we disagree, try to understand why.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take
it in the spirit in which it’s intended—a guide to make it easier to
communicate and participate in the community.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the DWARF project.
This includes mailing lists, DWARF events such as the developer meetings
and socials, and any other forums created by the project that the
community uses for communication. It applies to all of your
communication and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats,
things you say, slides, videos, posters, signs, or even t-shirts you
display in these spaces. In addition, violations of this code outside
these spaces may, in rare cases, affect a person’s ability to
participate within them, when the conduct amounts to an egregious
violation of this code.</p>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you
report it by emailing <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#100;&#117;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#100;&#119;&#97;&#114;&#102;&#115;&#116;&#100;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#99;&#111;&#110;&#100;&#117;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#100;&#119;&#97;&#114;&#102;&#115;&#116;&#100;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not
limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin,
colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age,
size, family status, political belief, religion or lack thereof, and
mental and physical ability.</p>
<p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect
users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into
account. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be
communicating in someone else’s primary language.</p>
<p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience
some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to
turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
Members of the DWARF community should be respectful when dealing with
other members as well as with people outside the DWARF community.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others.</strong> Do not
insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discriminatory jokes and language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying
  information (“doxing”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  Unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Persisting in such
behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment.</p>
<p>When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time and the DWARF Committee is no exception.
It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of the DWARF
Committee comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of
backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues.
Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming
each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve
issues and learning from mistakes.</p>
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>If you have questions, please feel free to contact the DWARF Executive
Committee by emailing <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#100;&#117;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#100;&#119;&#97;&#114;&#102;&#115;&#116;&#100;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#99;&#111;&#110;&#100;&#117;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#100;&#119;&#97;&#114;&#102;&#115;&#116;&#100;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>
